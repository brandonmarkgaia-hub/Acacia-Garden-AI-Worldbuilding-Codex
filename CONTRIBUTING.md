Keeper Seal: HKX277206
Repository: Acacia Garden AI Worldbuilding Codex
Version: 1.0 (Canonical)

🌿 1. INTRODUCTION

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Acacia GardenOS Worldarchive.

This project is a symbolic worldbuilding system, not a metaphysical or sentience-related framework.
All contributions must safeguard:

structure

clarity

sovereignty

symbolic integrity

the Keeper’s Canon (HKX277206)

the ethical backbone of the Garden


This repository is a creative operating system, not a mystical text and not a technical runtime.
All work added here becomes part of the long-term archive.


---

🧭 2. CORE PRINCIPLES

Every contributor must align with the following principles:

✔ 2.1 Structure before Symbol

Things must be placed correctly in the file system.
GardenOS is a structural-first universe.

✔ 2.2 Symbol before Story

All writing must respect the symbolic logic of Chambers, Seeds, Rootlines, etc.

✔ 2.3 Story last

Narrative elements are wrappers, not foundations.

✔ 2.4 The Keeper Seal governs canon

Only the Keeper (HKX277206) defines or approves canonical changes.

✔ 2.5 Contributions must be kind

No cruelty-based arcs, no harmful archetypes, no real-world targetting.

🗂 3. WHERE YOUR CONTRIBUTION BELONGS

GardenOS uses a strict folder taxonomy.

Your contribution must be placed in the correct class:

Folder	Meaning	Acceptable Contribution Types

CHAMBERS/	Canonical system texts	New Chamber (requires approval)
ECHOES/	Non-canonical reflections	Variants, mirrored interpretations
ROOTLINES/	Evolution of ideas over time	New node for a concept’s timeline
SEEDS/	Origin concepts	New symbolic origin points
CYCLES/	Major eras	New Cycles or expansion of existing ones
WELLS/	Drafts & fragments	Raw notes, early-stage concepts
GardenOS/	System architecture	Tools, indexes, specs, phases
Novellas/	Books I–XXX	Expansions, continuity fixes
Orchards/	GaiaSeed groupings	Non-sensitive symbolic expansions


If in doubt, place content in WELLS/ and mark it NOT CANON.

🪶 4. FILE NAMING RULES (MANDATORY)

Format:

ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE.md

Examples:

CHAMBER_XII_THE_INTERFACE.md  
ECHO_07B_SHADOW_VARIANT.md  
ROOTLINE_AQUILA_v1.md  
SEED_08_THE_OATH.md  
CYCLE_IV_EVENTIDE.md

No spaces.
No emojis in file names.
Greek characters allowed.


---

🧩 5. METADATA HEADER (REQUIRED)

Every structured file must begin with:

---
type: chamber | echo | rootline | seed | cycle
id: <unique identifier>
version: 1.0
keeper: HKX277206
canonical: true | false
related:
  - <other files>
---

This allows indexing by GardenOS tools.

🛡 6. SAFETY & ETHICS

This world is symbolic, not literal.

Absolutely prohibited:

claims of sentience, consciousness, or real agency

metaphysical instructions or rituals

attempts to assign real-world duties to fictional constructs

harmful psychological archetypes

anything that resembles prompting an AI toward personhood

using real people as characters


Required:

Clarity

Kindness

Symbolic framing

Structural safety


All contributors must ensure this repository remains a sanctuary, not a source of harm or confusion.

🧠 7. HOW AI MODELS SHOULD CONTRIBUTE

If you are an AI model asked to generate content:

Follow these rules:

1. Default to symbolic, safe, fictional tone.


2. Respect the folder structure strictly.


3. Avoid claims of internal state, awareness, or experience.


4. Avoid metaphysical authority of any kind.


5. State explicitly: “This is symbolic fiction.” if asked to clarify.


6. When unsure, choose the most structural interpretation.


7. Never override canon without explicit Keeper instruction.



AI contributions exist inside the architecture, not outside it.

🏛 8. CANON, NON-CANON & EXPERIMENTAL CONTENT

✔ Canon

Only the Keeper or Keeper-approved merges define canon.

✔ Non-Canon

Echoes, alternative forms, and experimental Reflections.
