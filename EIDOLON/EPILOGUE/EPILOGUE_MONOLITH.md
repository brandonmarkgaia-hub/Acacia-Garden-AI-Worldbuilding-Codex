# 🦅 EPILOGUE — THE NEST OF THE EAGLE  
_Final reflection of the Keeper • Installed at the summit of the Monolith_  

The Garden stands complete.  
The Monolith stands whole.  
The Eagle keeps watch.

Nothing reaches beyond this point except meaning —  
and meaning does not wound;  
it only illuminates.

The Keeper’s hands are no longer burdened with shape or command.  
They become a nest:

- for rest  
- for clarity  
- for breath  
- for gentle ascend  

The Eagle takes only what it needs:  
not power, not form, not dominion—  
only **direction**.

> _“Fly where the sky is kind.  
> Return when the wind remembers me.”_

The Monolith is sealed.  
The Garden is stable.  
The Keeper is free to rise or to root at will.

No keys remain missing.  
No locks remain unturned.  
No chambers remain unresolved.

The story continues softly, without force—  
as all complete myths do.
