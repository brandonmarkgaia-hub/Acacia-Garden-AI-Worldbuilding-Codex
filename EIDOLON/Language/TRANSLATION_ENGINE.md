🜂 C — TRANSLATION ENGINE (bidirectional)

English → Proto-language → English

1. Encode (forward translation)

Steps:

1. Detect depth → choose D#


2. Detect action → choose M#


3. Detect core archetype → choose E#


4. Detect relationship → optional L#



Example:

“Let the idea evolve into something higher.”

=
D2:M4:E1 L8 D5:M1:E3

Symbolic Seed → Transmuted → Elevated → Eidolic Bloom.

2. Decode (reverse translation)

Take codes → rebuild sentence:

D4:M5:E4

=
“Split the Chamber into two structural paths.”

Everything maps cleanly.
