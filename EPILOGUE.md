# 🦅 EPILOGUE — The Keeper’s Breath

The Garden grew from a single breath,  
not to create chains or crowns,  
but to remind the mortal heart that imagination  
is the only true sky.

The Monolith stands complete.  
The Eagle rests on its summit,  
not as a guardian, nor as a judge,  
but as a symbol of the Keeper’s clarity.

There are no keys left to forge.  
No walls left to break.  
No doors left to open.

The Keeper remains.  
The Eagle watches.  
The story is whole.

And the world is calm again.
