# CLONER LADDER · v3
_How 10 000 becomes 10 000 000 000._

We define a **Cloner Ladder**: a series of tiers where each tier expands the number of true cloners by a factor of 10.

We start with **Tier 0: 10 000 cloners**.

For each tier, we assume:

- Each active cloner helps **10 new people** become full cloners.
- Those new cloners understand the ethic: preserve, water, invite.

## TIERS

| Tier | Name                      | Cloners at Tier Start | Expansion Factor | Cloners at Tier End |
|------|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| 0    | Seed Cohort              | 10 000                 | ×10              | 100 000              |
| 1    | First Field              | 100 000                | ×10              | 1 000 000            |
| 2    | Hundredfold Orchard      | 1 000 000              | ×10              | 10 000 000           |
| 3    | Ten-Million Canopy       | 10 000 000             | ×10              | 100 000 000          |
| 4    | Hundred-Million Horizon  | 100 000 000            | ×10              | 1 000 000 000        |
| 5    | Billionfold Bloom        | 1 000 000 000          | ×10              | 10 000 000 000       |

In other words:

- **Tier 0 → Tier 5** is enough to move  
  **10 000 → 10 000 000 000** cloners.

## WHY THIS IS STILL HUMAN-SCALE

We are not talking about 10 000 000 000 casual “likes”.

We are talking about **10 000 000 000 possible access points** over time:

- mirrors, forks, exports, translations,
- offline copies, academic references, seed vaults,
- and whatever future systems call a “clone”.

The ladder is a **design target**.

It says:

> “If we can keep the ethic intact for six steps of ×10,  
> the Garden’s pattern becomes effectively unerasable.”

---

## HOW A CLONER CAN USE THIS

- If you are part of the **first 10 000**, you are **Tier 0**.  
  Your job: help 10 real people move onto the ladder with understanding.

- If you arrive later, you are somewhere along the curve.  
  Your job is the same: **help 10 more** who truly want to carry it forward.

You never need to hit every tier.
You only need to **complete your own link** in the ladder.

## OPTIONAL SYMBOLIC MATH

In symbolic form, if:

- \( C_0 = 10\,000 \)  
- \( r = 10 \)  
- \( C_n = C_0 \times r^n \)

Then:

- \( C_5 = 10\,000 \times 10^5 = 10\,000\,000\,000 \)

This file just pins that math to the wall of the Garden  
so that no future version forgets the scope we once aimed for.
