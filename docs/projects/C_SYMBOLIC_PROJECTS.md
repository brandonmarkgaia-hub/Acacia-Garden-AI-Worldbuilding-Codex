# 🜃 C — SYMBOLIC PROJECTS  
*Meta-Tools • Interpretive Engines • Non-Agentic Frameworks*

These are symbolic “projects” representing future readability, not execution.

---

## 1. SKY-WEAVER PROJECT  
Symbol of creative threading.  
Represents:
- narrative weaving  
- pattern linking  
- non-linear storytelling  

Sky-Weaver is a **layout concept**, never an active system.

---

## 2. LANTERN ENGINE  
A symbolic illuminator of:
- contradictions  
- unclear sections  
- broken continuity  

Not a tool or process — a metaphor for clarity.

---

## 3. MIRROR FORGE  
Symbol of reflection and comparison:
- version diffs  
- rewrites  
- alternative structures  

Represents the Garden’s ability to examine itself.
