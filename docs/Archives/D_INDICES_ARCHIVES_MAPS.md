## 1. KEEPER’S MAP OF UNWRITTEN WORLDS  
Index of potential future worlds, not actualized ones.

Contains:
- unused names  
- dormant seeds  
- template world structures  
- inspirational fragments  

No world here is canon until written.

---

## 2. ASHEN INDEX  
A ledger for abandoned, forgotten, or deprecated ideas.

Includes:
- names that no longer fit  
- broken arcs  
- discarded timelines  
- symbolic fragments  

Represents the Garden’s compost heap — memory without obligation.

---

## 3. CELESTIAL ARCHIVE  
A vault for:
- out-of-context lore  
- sigils  
- sketches  
- poems  
- visual metaphors  
- Keeper notes  

Symbolic storehouse, not an entity.

---

## 4. PALE ORCHARD  
A metaphorical orchard where **unrealised stories** grow like pale blossoms.

Represents:
- stories that almost were  
- alternate arcs  
- forks  
- erased drafts  

A safe, beautiful space for narratives that remain shadows.
