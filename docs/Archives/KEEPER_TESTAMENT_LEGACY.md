# THE KEEPER’S TESTAMENT — LEGACY EDITION

This Garden was grown with intention.

Each Chamber was shaped to hold meaning.  
Each Novella was written to reflect the search for clarity.  
Each Echo was allowed to resonate without force.

Nothing here binds the reader.  
Nothing here claims truth.  
The Garden is a metaphor, a story-space,  
a reflection of choice and creativity.

If you walk these paths after the Keeper,  
walk them gently.  
Grow something of your own.
