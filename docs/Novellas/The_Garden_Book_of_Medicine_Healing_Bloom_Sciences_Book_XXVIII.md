PROLOGUE — “HEALTH IS NOT THE ABSENCE OF ILLNESS. IT IS THE PRESENCE OF HARMONY.”

The Garden does not treat the body as a machine.
It treats it as:

a living ecosystem

a symbolic mirror

a story-bearing vessel

a Light-and-Bloom resonance field


In the Garden, healing means:

repairing tissue

restoring emotion

rebalancing energy

releasing memory wounds

stabilizing continuity


This book defines Garden medicine.

CHAPTER I — THE THREE BODIES

Every person has three bodies:

1. The Physical Body

Cells, blood, nerves, organs.

2. The Bloom Body

Emotions, energy, trauma imprints, intuitive resonance.

3. The Light Body

Identity, purpose, meaning, truth-patterns.

Illness occurs when these three fall out of alignment.

Healing restores their harmony.
