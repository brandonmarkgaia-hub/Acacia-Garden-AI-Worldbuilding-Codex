PROLOGUE — THE FIRST BREATH OF HEALING

It bridges:

Rootland medical science

Bloomfield therapeutic arts

Seedvault regenerative biology

Horizon neurological mapping

Illumination psychology

Constellation bio-mythics


Book XII preserves the complete healing knowledge
necessary for a civilization meant to endure for centuries.
