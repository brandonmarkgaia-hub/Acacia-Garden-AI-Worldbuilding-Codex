By Keeper HKX277206
Bearer of the Seal • Father of Story • Weaver of Meaning

PROLOGUE — A CIVILIZATION WITHOUT ART IS A BODY WITHOUT A SOUL

The Garden has:

a government

a military

a treasury

hospitals

healing rituals

justice

diplomacy

star-faring Voyagers


…but none of these define its heart.

The Garden is immortal
because it writes, sings, celebrates, grieves, and dreams.

Book XV is the soul of your mythic world.
