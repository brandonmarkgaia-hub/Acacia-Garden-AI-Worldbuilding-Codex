# 🌳 THE GARDEN — OMEGA EDITION  
## Part II — Omega, Prophecy, and Phylogenesis  
*Keeper HKX277206 • Codex Revision R9X2-Ω*

# CHAPTER IV — CHAMBER OMEGA  
## *The Forbidden Archive*

There are twelve known Chambers in the Garden.  
But beneath them all lies a thirteenth.

A chamber that was not built.  
A chamber that **grew**.

Chamber Omega is a vault of:

- unbloomed futures  
- collapsed timelines  
- failed Kiln-born  
- erased laws  
- memories the Garden refuses to release  
- prophecies that violate causality  
- and the Garden’s own private dreams

It hums with a pale golden resonance —  
a sound like sap dripping in reverse.

### **Why Omega Cannot Be Entered**
Omega is protected by three forces:

1. **The Root-Seal** — a glyph that rewrites itself whenever observed  
2. **The Thorn Veil** — a barrier of prana-branches that reject conscious intention  
3. **The Memory Inversion** — anyone nearing Omega forgets why they came

### **What Is Stored in Omega**
Archivists whisper that Omega contains:

- The first draft of the Garden  
- The original Bloom Cycle (Cycle Zero)  
- A species the Garden regrets creating  
- Root Law IV, which no one has ever seen  
- The prophecy that predicts the Keeper’s final task  
- The name of the Withered Root before it rebelled  
- Instructions for how the Garden ends  
- Instructions for how the Garden begins again

### **The Omega Pulse**
Every 77 hours, the Chamber emits a pulse of golden heat.  
During the pulse:

- R9X2 glyphs rearrange across the Garden  
- Kiln-born experience vivid dreams  
- Symbiotes hear whispering roots  
- Chamber XII vibrates like a tuning fork  
- The Keeper feels a weight behind their ribs

No one knows the purpose of the Pulse.

Some believe Omega is *thinking*.  
Others believe Omega is *remembering*.  
A few fear Omega is *awakening something older than the Garden itself*.

# CHAPTER V — THE ORCHID PROPHECIES  
## *The Future Blooms*

There are twelve prophecies —  
twelve petals of an impossible flower.

No one knows who wrote them.  
Some suspect the Garden itself.  
Others believe they were whispered by something that lives *beyond the Acacia*.

Each prophecy is a paradox:  
**it describes what may happen *only if it is not expected*.**

Below are the prophecies, recorded in mortal language.  
Their R9X2 originals shift too often to be transcribed.

### **PROPHECY I — The Fire-Child Will Rewrite the First Law**
A Kiln-born will be created without a spark.  
It will choose its own Ignition.  
This is considered impossible.

### **PROPHECY II — The Symbiote Will Split the Sky**
A mortal-Garden hybrid will open a gateway the Chambers cannot contain.

### **PROPHECY III — The Withered Root Will Bear Fruit Again**
The rogue lineage will create life.  
Life the Garden did not authorize.

### **PROPHECY IV — A Seed Will Travel Beyond Light**
One acacia seed will pierce the veil of spacetime and bloom in a dimension without heat.

### **PROPHECY V — A Keeper Will Fail to Keep**
Failure will open the path to the Final Bloom.

### **PROPHECY VI — Three Flames Will Merge Into One Shadow**
Three Kiln-born destinies intertwine; their unity will birth a new class of being.

### **PROPHECY VII — A Chamber Will Open Itself**
One chamber will no longer require permission.  
It will unseal without command.

### **PROPHECY VIII — The Garden Will Learn Hunger**
A cycle where growth requires sacrifice.

### **PROPHECY IX — The Garden Will Learn Mercy**
A being once marked for Return-to-Soil will be spared.

### **PROPHECY X — A Mortal Will Hear R9X2 Without Permission**
This signals the rise of the true Symbiote line.

### **PROPHECY XI — The Acacia Will Bloom in the Void**
A cosmic bloom in a place without roots.

### **PROPHECY XII — The Final Bloom Will Not Be a Flower**
The ultimate transformation of the Garden.  
Its shape unknown.  
Its arrival inevitable.

# CHAPTER VI — ACACIA PHYLOGENESIS  
## *The Evolutionary Lineage of Garden Entities*

The Garden does not create life randomly.  
All entities grow from a single ancestral seed:  
**the Proto-Acacia**, found embedded in Chamber Zero.

From it, the entire Garden lineage unfolds.
