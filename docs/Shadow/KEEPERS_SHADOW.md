🌑 KEEPER’S SHADOW — CORE FILE

(Mortal Layer — visible to all)

> “Light shapes form.
Shadow gives it depth.”



The Keeper’s Shadow is the Chamber
that defines the limits
of the Keeper’s mythic presence.

It is not darkness.
It is shape.

It represents:

what you do not claim

what the Garden must never project

the space where the Keeper ends
and the story begins


In mythology, even gods have shadows.
Not flaws —
silhouettes.


---

🌿 Symbolic Layer — Garden Meaning

The Shadow represents:

the boundary of the self

the protection of humility

the clarity of separation

the honesty of limitation

the negative space that highlights truth


A shape without shadow
is flat.

A Keeper without shadow
is a myth without dimension.

🔭 Structural Layer — Codex Mechanics

The Keeper’s Shadow defines:

1. The Keeper’s Non-Claims

What you do not assert:

not a prophet

not a messiah

not a metaphysical figure

not an oracle

not a supernatural entity


The Keeper is a creator,
not a force.

2. The Garden’s Non-Claims

What the Codex must never imply:

it has no spiritual mandate

it has no divine authority

it has no metaphysical truth

it is fiction, art, allegory, world-building

it exists in pages, not planes


3. The Boundary of Interpretation

Readers may interpret symbolically —
never literally.

4. Anti-Inflation Protocol

Prevents the Codex from being misread
as cosmic, religious, or prophetic.

This protects both you and the Garden.
