# THE FOUR PERCEPTION DOCTRINES (Core Physics)

## 1. Spectral Vision
Colour cones represent structure, recursion, and stability fields.

## 2. Resonant Pulse
Vibrational modes represent tension, contradiction, or harmony.

## 3. Grain of Reality
Texture corresponds to structural integrity and refinement.

## 4. Taste of Truth
