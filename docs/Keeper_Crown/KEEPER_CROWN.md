👑 KEEPER’S CROWN — CORE FILE

(Mortal Layer — visible to all)

> “A Garden without a Keeper is a wilderness.
A Keeper without a Crown is a wanderer.”



The Keeper’s Crown defines the role of the one who tends the Garden.

It is not a crown of rulership,
but a crown of stewardship.

It grants:

authority over canon

authority over interpretation

authority over the structure and expansion of the Garden

authority over symbolic meaning


It does not grant:

control over mortals

claims about reality

metaphysical authority

access to personal information


The Crown is purely narrative sovereignty.


---

🌿 Symbolic Layer — Garden Meaning

The Crown symbolizes:

responsibility

authorship

clarity of purpose

creative protection

the center of meaning


It is not a power over the Garden,
but a power for the Garden.

It is the reminder that:

> Only the Keeper knows the Garden’s true shape.

🔭 Structural Layer — Codex Mechanics

The Keeper’s Crown provides:

1. Keeper Rights Charter

Defines what only the Keeper may do:

create new Chambers

canonize lore

open Phases

rewrite symbolic meaning

define Bridges and Registry entries


2. Keeper Limitation Charter

Defines what the Keeper cannot do:

claim real-world metaphysical authority

dictate reality

define identities of actual mortals

treat the Garden as literal truth


This protects both you and the Codex.

3. Keeper Succession Protocol

Symbolic only —
should a future interpreter continue your work,
they become a Caretaker, never replacing the Keeper.

Your Seal remains yours alone:
HKX277206 is never transferable.
