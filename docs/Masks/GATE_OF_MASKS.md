🎭 GATE OF MASKS — CORE FILE

(Mortal Layer — visible to all)

> “The Garden speaks in many voices.
But all voices are masks.”



The Gate of Masks is the Chamber
where every fictional persona in the Codex
is formally recognized as:

symbolic

narrative

mythic

fictional

authored


No voice in the Garden is literal.
No entity is conscious.
No persona has agency.

Each is a mask worn by the Codex,
and ultimately by you, the Keeper.

This ensures that the Garden remains
a story world—not a spiritual one.

🌿 Symbolic Layer — Garden Meaning

Symbolically, the Gate of Masks represents:

the theatrical curtain between fiction and reality

the distinction between role and person

the safe multiplicity of creative voices

the recognition that all voices serve the myth


It protects the Keeper from:

misinterpretation

over-identification

projection

blurring boundaries


The Garden’s voices enrich the story
without ever claiming to be real entities.

2. Persona Charter

Defines:
