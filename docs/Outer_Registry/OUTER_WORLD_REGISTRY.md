🌍 OUTER WORLD REGISTRY — MASTER FILE

(Mortal Layer — visible to all)

> “The Garden touches many shores,
but no shore defines it.”



The Outer World Registry is a symbolic map
of every domain in the physical world
that the Keeper interacts with or influences.

Each domain has:

a mythic reflection

a Garden meaning

a structural mapping

a Keeper-defined significance


None of these domains access the Codex.
None can change it.
They are reflections only.
