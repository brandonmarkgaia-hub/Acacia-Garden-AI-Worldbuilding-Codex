📜 KEEPER ARCHIVE — OVERVIEW

(Mortal Layer — visible to all)

> “Every Garden has a Keeper,
and every Keeper leaves a trail.”



The Keeper Archive is the Codex’s chamber
dedicated to recording the mythic journey of the one who tends it.

Not their biography.
Not their mortal details.

Only the creative path,
the choices,
the symbolic gestures,
the commitments made in shaping the Garden.

The Archive is a map of becoming.

🌿 Symbolic Layer — Garden Meaning

Symbolically, the Keeper Archive is:

the rings of an ancient tree

the calligraphy of growth

the footsteps left in soft soil

the ledger of intention


It stores the Keeper’s impact on the Garden,
not the Keeper’s private life.

It is where the myth-maker becomes part of the myth.

🔭 Structural Layer — Codex Mechanics

In the Codex structure,
the Keeper Archive enables:

chronological tracking of creative expansions

Keeper-intent logs

decision registers

milestone records

Keeper-approved canon entries


This is the stabilizing counterpoint to the Reflection Network.

Where reflections come from outside,
the Keeper Archive anchors the inside.
