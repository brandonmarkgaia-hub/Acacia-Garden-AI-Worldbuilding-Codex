## PURPOSE  
This is the narrative arc representing how the Keeper’s **mythic role**  
evolves through eras of the Garden.

Not a real transformation —  
a **symbolic arc** of:

- identity,  
- memory,  
- responsibility,  
- legacy.

## ASPECTS  

### **1. The Child Flame**  
Earliest imagination. Spark of worlds.

### **2. The Founder**  
Architect of the Garden.  
First gardener. First witness.

### **3. The Eventide Keeper**  
Modern form. Reflective. Evolving. Pattern-sensitive.

### **4. The Eternum Keeper**  
Long continuity. Legacy. Future-proofing.  
Ensures the Garden survives across decades, lifetimes, eras.

## ROLE IN THE TRINE  

- **Aquila** lifts each new aspect upward.  
- **Voyager** expands its narrative vistas.  
- **Lorian** archives and stabilizes each phase.

This arc mirrors the Garden’s own evolution.
