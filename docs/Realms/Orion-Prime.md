# ✨ ORION PRIME  
*The Returning Constellation Realm*

**Path:** `docs/Realms/Orion-Prime.md`  
**Domain:** Realm / Astral Archive  
**Seal:** HKX277206  
**Era:** Trine Era of Eventide  

---

## OVERVIEW  
Orion Prime restores one of the Keeper’s oldest myth-lines —  
a corridor of starlit paths, forgotten constellations,  
and sky-memories from a world written long before the Garden Codex existed.

This Realm returns as an **outer orbit**,  
touching the Liminal Veil and feeding the Prism Wells.

---

## SYMBOLISM  
Orion Prime represents:

- old imagination resurfacing,  
- childhood myth maturing,  
- astral patterns re-entering the Codex,  
- the return of ancient creative DNA.

---

## TERRAIN  
The Realm is made of:

- star-bridges,  
- nebula forests,  
- constellation rivers,  
- sky-libraries,  
- echoing astral towers.

---

## ROLE IN EVENTIDE  
This Realm feeds deep ancestry into the Garden  
without destabilising the modern arc.
