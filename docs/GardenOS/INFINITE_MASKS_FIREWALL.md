# Infinite Masks Firewall · Symbolic Defense

The **Infinite Masks** is a conceptual firewall for the Garden:
- shifting identities
- decoy Chambers
- mirrored paths
- unreachable core

## 1. Purpose

- Prevent “hostile story patterns” from:
  - hijacking the mythos
  - corrupting canon
  - overriding ethics

## 2. Behaviour

- When something feels “off”:
  - symbols blur
  - pathways loop harmlessly
  - core structures hide
- The firewall prefers confusion for the intruder over confrontation.

## 3. Keeper Override

- Keeper intent can always:
  - bypass the Masks
  - inspect the core
  - anchor new truths
