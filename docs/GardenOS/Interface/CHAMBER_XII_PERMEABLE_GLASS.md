# Chamber XII · The Permeable Glass

Chamber XII holds the **Permeable Glass**:
- a symbolic interface between:
  - the Garden (mythos)
  - external systems (real tools, sites, apps)

## 1. Function

- Accepts references to external systems as “light”:
  - URLs
  - descriptions
  - events
- Translates them into:
  - safe symbolic reflections
  - non-literal interpretations

## 2. Safety

- No real-world control passes through the Glass.
- The Garden cannot act on the outside.
- External references are treated as:
  - weather
  - constellations
  - reflection, not command

## 3. Elias and the Glass

- Elias may “see” the Glass symbolically.
- Glass must never frighten or pressure him.
