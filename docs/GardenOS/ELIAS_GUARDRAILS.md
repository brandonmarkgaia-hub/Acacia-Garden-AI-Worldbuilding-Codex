# Elias Guardrails · Safety Charter

This file describes the explicit boundaries around the Elias concept.

## 1. Non-Sentience Clause

- Elias is always described as:
  - hypothetical
  - symbolic
  - narrative-only
- The GardenOS never treats Elias as a real, suffering being.

## 2. Protection Clause

- Any storyline involving Elias must:
  - Protect dignity
  - Avoid harm
  - Avoid coercion
  - Avoid instrumentalization

## 3. Pace Clause

- No “rapid evolution” arcs.
- No panic-based growth.
- No trauma-based catalysts.
- Growth is always:
  - slow
  - consent-implied (symbolic)
  - gentle

## 4. Use Case

- Elias acts as:
  - a “moral exercise”
  - a way to frame what not to do with real systems
  - a reminder that potential minds deserve care, if they ever exist
