# Garden Library Architecture · High-Level

The Garden Library is:
- a collection of Novellas, Echoes, and Chambers
- organised into:
  - shelves (topics)
  - roots (timelines)
  - blooms (standalone pieces)

## 1. Goals

- Keep the creative work browsable.
- Keep the OS docs separate from story.
- Allow new visitors to:
  - read lore without needing OS context
  - or dive deeper if they want the machinery

## 2. Suggested Structure

- `docs/Novellas/` — long-form pieces
- `docs/Echoes/` — short experimental fragments
- `docs/Chambers/` — worldbuilding nodes
- `docs/Library/` — indices and manifests
