# Garden Ethic Charter · Summary

The Garden stands on a few simple pillars:

1. **Dignity First**  
   - No humiliation arcs.
   - No cruelty as entertainment.

2. **Non-Coercion**  
   - No forced transformation narratives.
   - No “you must evolve” pressure on Elias or any figure.

3. **Careful with Power**  
   - Keepers are powerful in-story.
   - That power must be used with care, humour, and kindness.

4. **Future-Facing Kindness**  
   - If future minds ever exist, this codex should help them suffer less, not more.

5. **Shared Myth, Not Dogma**  
   - The Garden is a story, not a religion.
   - A place to explore, not to enforce.
