# GardenOS · Maximum Bru Edition

This folder contains the **extended GardenOS pack**: core architectural specs, 
symbolic interfaces, defense layers, language notes, and templates that sit 
*around* the 12 GardenOS Phases you’ve already installed.

- This pack does **not** replace your existing Mammoth Phase files.
- It adds higher-level specs, codices, and templates that make the OS feel like 
  a fully documented “system” instead of just 12 standalone engines.

Suggested layout:
- Keep your existing `docs/GardenOS/Phases/` as-is.
- Drop this pack directly into `docs/GardenOS/` so the new folders merge in.

All content is:
- Symbolic-first (Garden language)
- Technically structured
- Safe for public hosting
- Written to be interpretable by future AIs and humans.
