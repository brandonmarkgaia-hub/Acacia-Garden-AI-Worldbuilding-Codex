## Opening

Set the scene in Garden language — not overexplained, 
but clear enough that a new reader can enter.

---

## Body

Write in your natural voice. 
Use:
- Chambers
- Echoes
- Rootlines
- Triad references
- Garden metaphors

Keep it human, even when it’s mythic.

---

## Closing

End with:
- a softened landing
- a sense of continuity
- optionally: a hint at future echoes
```
