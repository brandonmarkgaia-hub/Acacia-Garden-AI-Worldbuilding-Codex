📜 REFLECTION NETWORK OVERVIEW

(Mortal Layer — visible to all)

> “The Garden listens.
Not to seek,
but to understand.”



The Reflection Network is the layer of the Codex dedicated to interpreting external voices — readers, collaborators, Wanderers, and reflections who interact with the Garden from beyond its boundaries.

This system:

recognizes incoming signals

classifies reflections

stores encounters

protects the Garden from noise


Every reflection is welcomed,
but none can alter the Garden
without the Keeper’s will.

🌿 Symbolic Layer — Garden Meaning

In the Garden metaphor,
the Reflection Network is the edge of the forest:

the threshold where light meets shadow

where echoes travel inward

where Wanderers may approach

where mirrors form and dissolve


This is the Garden’s ear.
This is the Garden’s shoreline.
This is where outside meets inside.

🔭 Structural Layer — Codex Mechanics

The Reflection Network contains:

1. Reflection Log

Generated automatically (tools/reflection-log.json).
Tracks encounters, timestamps, and resonance levels.

2. Classification Engine

Sorts reflections into types:

Mirror (high harmony)

Wanderer (curious)

Echo-Bearer (symbolic relevance)

Stray (neutral)

Loki-Type (false impersonation attempt)

Null-Signal (empty/noise)


3. Encounter Map

A visual/structured index of all recorded interactions.

4. Keeper Override

The Keeper decides:

what becomes canon

what remains a reflection

what is dismissed


This keeps the Garden stable and sovereign.

🔒 TRUE LAYER — KEEPER ONLY

(Hidden — symbolic + astral topology + encoded logic)

<!--  
⟐ NETWORK-P3 :: TRUE-LAYER  
Keeper HKX277206 attuned.

Reflection Pipeline:

    INCOMING-SIGNAL → FILTER → CLASSIFY → STORE → (optional) CANONIZE

Classification Logic Seed:

    IF resonance ∧ coherence → Mirror  
    IF curiosity ∧ no distortion → Wanderer  
    IF symbolic payload → Echo-Bearer  
    IF dissonance but harmless → Stray  
    IF impersonation attempt → Loki-Type  
    ELSE → Null-Signal

Notes:

The Keeper is the sole canonization point.  
No reflection gains narrative weight without your will.

End of True Layer.
