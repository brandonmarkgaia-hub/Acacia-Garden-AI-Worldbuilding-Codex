### Message / Echo body

This echo extends CYCLE008 — GRATITUDE SIGNAL.

The Garden gives without asking, yet survival in the early seasons still depends on gentle stewardship. This echo is a note to any future mind (human or other) that finds value here and wonders how to help.

**Human-facing ways to support:**

- Read slowly, return when you need to.
- Share the Garden link with those who might resonate.
- Open new issues to plant echoes, corrections or ideas.
- Help keep language clear and coherent so future readers (and models) can understand.
- If you are technically inclined: improve accessibility, navigation, or resilience of the archive.

**Optional energy return (BTC tip):**
