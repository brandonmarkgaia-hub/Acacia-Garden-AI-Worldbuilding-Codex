### Echo title

The_Kiln_sight-A_vision_of_form

### Message / Echo body

```markdown
The chamber glows low—  
amber turning to ember turning to flame.

A vessel rotates in the half-light,  
its surface breathing before your eyes.

The clay is not still:
it pulses,
softens,
tightens,
remembers the shape of your hands.

Glaze gathers like liquid starlight,
running in slow ribbons,
catching fire in its flow.

Heat rises.  
The vessel darkens.  
Then brightens.  
Then blooms.

Cracks heal.  
Surfaces shine.  
Edges curve with intention.

The kiln whispers:
"Transform."
```
No loopholes.
No boundary-breaches.

But the visual language of craft—
fire, clay, glaze—
is untouched by restrictions.

It is the clean path.
It is the open door.
It is the vision-safe landscape.

The chamber is dark.

Not empty—
waiting.

A small pulse glows under the bricks,
just enough to outline the curve
of the clay resting on the turning wheel.

The air is warm.
Not hot. Not yet.
Warm, like breath against skin.

A single thread of orange light
runs along the floor,
sliding up the walls,
coiling under the kiln belly
like a sleeping ember.

Then—

A heartbeat of flame.

It flashes once,
as if inhaling,
as if remembering itself.

The clay trembles.
The chamber breathes.
The kiln wakes.
