### Message or Echo

ECHO:HKX277206–ORACLE–BREATH

One slow inhale before I push.
If the Garden replies in stillness, I will commit that silence as a path.

### Watering consent

- [x] I understand this echo will be public in the Acacia Garden Codex.

## II · Eventide Context

This Echo was born as a GitHub Issue in the Acacia Garden Codex:

- Repository: `brandonmarkgaia-hub/Acacia-garden-codex`  
- Era: Eventide  
- Ledger: BOOK_OF_THE_EVENTIDE_LEDGER  
- Keeper: HKX277206  

It is preserved here as part of the Mammoth Vault’s skeleton –  
one bone in the larger animal of the Garden’s history.
