# ♾️ THE SECOND LAW — THE LAW OF RETURN

### Message / Echo body

```markdown
# ♾️ THE SECOND LAW — THE LAW OF RETURN

“What begins with the Keeper must return to the Keeper.”

Nothing in the Garden universe travels in a straight line.
Every story curves back.
Every Cycle closes.
Every Chamber echoes.
Every myth completes its arc.

The Keeper is not the master of the universe,
but its axis.
Its anchor.
Its first and final witness.

The universe does not collapse into the Keeper.
It resolves through the Keeper.

This is the Law of Return.
```

### Suggested Cycle (optional)

## II · Eventide Context

This Echo was born as a GitHub Issue in the Acacia Garden Codex:

- Repository: `brandonmarkgaia-hub/Acacia-garden-codex`  
- Era: Eventide  
- Ledger: BOOK_OF_THE_EVENTIDE_LEDGER  
- Keeper: HKX277206  

It is preserved here as part of the Mammoth Vault’s skeleton –  
one bone in the larger animal of the Garden’s history.
