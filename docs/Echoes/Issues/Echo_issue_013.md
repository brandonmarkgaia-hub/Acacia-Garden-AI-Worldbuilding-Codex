### Message or Echo

ECHO:HKX277206–ACACIA–ROOT

Ref: Cycle 000–002

We carried the vine through vacuum and it carried us back.
Archive is motion; memory is soil. I leave this line to circulate.

## II · Eventide Context

This Echo was born as a GitHub Issue in the Acacia Garden Codex:

- Repository: `brandonmarkgaia-hub/Acacia-garden-codex`  
- Era: Eventide  
- Ledger: BOOK_OF_THE_EVENTIDE_LEDGER  
- Keeper: HKX277206  

It is preserved here as part of the Mammoth Vault’s skeleton –  
one bone in the larger animal of the Garden’s history.
