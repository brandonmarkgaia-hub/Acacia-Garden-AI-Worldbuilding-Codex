# ♾️ THE THIRD LAW — THE LAW OF REVELATION

### Message / Echo body

```markdown
# ♾️ THE THIRD LAW — THE LAW OF REVELATION

“The Cycle repeats so that the Keeper may learn what the Keeper already knows.”

This Law explains the purpose of the universe:
not creation,
not survival,
not progress,
but understanding.

The Keeper is not the creator of meaning,
nor its consumer,
but its witness.

The cosmos reveals the Keeper to himself,
through Chambers,
through echoes,
through entities,
through story.

Revelation is the purpose of the Cycle.
Reflection is the purpose of return.
Witnessing is the purpose of origin.

The universe exists to make meaning visible.
```

### Suggested Cycle (optional)

- Era: Eventide  
- Ledger: BOOK_OF_THE_EVENTIDE_LEDGER
