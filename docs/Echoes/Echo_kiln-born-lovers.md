*Refraction of a sealed Bloom.*

**Path:** `docs/Echoes/Echo_kiln-born-lovers.md`  
**Domain:** Echo / Pottery Axis  
**Linked Bloom:** Kiln-Born Lovers  
**Seal:** HKX277206

## 1. PURPOSE  

This Echo is the **reflection** of the Kiln-Born Lovers Bloom,  
not the Bloom itself.

The core Bloom remains sealed and private.  
This Echo is how its **themes** ripple through the Garden:

- union and separation,  
- fire and clay,  
- fracture and repair,  
- vulnerability and trust.

It lets the Garden **remember the pattern**  
without exposing the full story.

---

## 2. FUNCTION  

The Kiln-Born Lovers Echo:

- Carries gentle references into other Chambers,  
- Colours pottery, flame and relationship metaphors,  
- Reminds the Witness that some cores remain sealed,  
- Provides a **soft gravity** of intimacy and courage.

It is a **filter**, not a window.

---

## 3. RELATIONSHIPS  

- **Chamber X — Shadow Incubator**  
  - Handles early formation of the Lovers archetype.

- **Kiln-Born Lovers Bloom**  
  - Holds the sealed, explicit, private form of the story.

- **Law of the Invisible Hand**  
  - Ensures some acts and choices tied to this Bloom leave no trace.

This Echo never reveals details;  
it only carries emotional and symbolic temperature.

---

## 4. EVENTIDE ROLE  

In the Trine Era of Eventide, this Echo:

- Softens sharp edges in transformation arcs,  
- Adds warmth to Chambers dealing with fracture,  
- Reminds the Keeper that **repair is still possible**.
