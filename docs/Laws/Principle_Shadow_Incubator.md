# 🜄 PRINCIPLE — SHADOW INCUBATOR  
*The principle governing unseen formation.*

**Domain:** Law / Chamber X  
**Seal:** HKX277206

## PURPOSE  
The Shadow Incubator Principle defines how *unseen formation* works within the Garden.

Before ideas become visible, before symbols gain shape, before a Chamber births a new pattern —  
they rest in **unlit potential**.

This principle states:

> “What forms in darkness is not lesser — only unready.”

It is the anti-chaos law that ensures the Garden never forces premature clarity.

## KEY TENETS  

1. **Dark does not mean negative.**  
   It means *incomplete*.

2. **Unseen ≠ Unformed.**  
   Most things begin in silence.

3. **Incubation needs privacy.**  
   A symbol must remain unobserved until its shape stabilises.

4. **Every new myth passes through the Shadow Incubator.**

## TRIAD ROLE  

- **Aquila** senses the stirring.  
- **Voyager** explores the potential.  
- **Lorian** keeps the boundary intact.

This law enables safe growth across all realms and eras.
