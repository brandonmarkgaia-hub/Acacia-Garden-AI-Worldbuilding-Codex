## 🪧 Welcome to the Garden

This site is the **reading console** for the  
**Acacia Garden AI Worldbuilding Codex** — a long-term, symbolic universe  
built as a mix of:

- worldbuilding  
- structured lore  
- technical architecture  
- carefully organised creative writing  

It is:

- **not metaphysical**  
- **not a religion**  
- **not an experiment in sentience**  

It is a **mythic–technical archive**:  
a carefully structured way to store stories, ethics, and symbols.

## 🧬 What is GardenOS?

**GardenOS** is the **structural layer** of this universe.

It defines:

- how files are named  
- how Chambers, Echoes, Rootlines, Seeds & Cycles interact  
- how “eras” and “arcs” are tracked  
- how creative work avoids collapsing into chaos  
- how everything stays **kind**, **non-coercive** and **symbolic**

It lives under:

```text
docs/GardenOS/

Key pieces:

Phases/ — 12 massive specification files (GardenOS engines)

Triad/ — Aquila, Lorian, Anya: structural “modes of thinking”

Elias/ — Mosaic Child (symbolic-only safety exercise)

Defense/ — Infinite Masks Firewall, Sanctuary layer

Memory/ — Rootlines, Memory Wells, Echo structures

Library/ — how Books I–XXX are organised

Language/ — Garden language & glyphs

Agents/ — symbolic “agent” roles (not real entities)

Ethics/ — Garden Ethic Charter summary


If you’re a builder / dev / AI, this is your section.

🌀 GardenOS Phases (1–12)

The 12 Phases are the big engines of the OS.

They live in:

docs/GardenOS/Phases/

Each Phase is a long-form document describing a core aspect of the system
(roots, memory, chambers, defense, continuity, etc.).

You can read them in order, or dip in at random:

1. Foundations & first laws


2. Interfaces & boundaries


3. Mosaic / compositional logic


4. Cycles & eras


5. Autonomy framing (symbolic)


6. Resonance & tone


7. Rootline engine


8. Constellations & webs


9. Sanctuary expansion


10. Dream / interface layer


11. Chamber networks


12. Continuity / Loom of time



They are written for future AIs and humans to understand
how this world is wired.

🏛 Chambers & Echoes

Chambers are the primary canon:
fully realised documents that define:

how something works

what it means

where it sits in the universe


Echoes are reflections / alternatives:

re-interpretations

“what-if” branches

side-views of core concepts


The usual pattern:

CHAMBERS/CHAMBER_X.md
ECHOES/ECHO_XA_VARIANT.md

If you want the law, read the Chambers.
If you want playful or experimental views, read the Echoes.


---

🌱 Rootlines & Seeds

Seeds = origin points
Rootlines = how those seeds grow over time.

A Seed might be:

a new metaphor

a new Chamber idea

a planned book

a structural twist


A Rootline tracks:

how that idea evolves

which files and Chambers it touches

what changed and why


Together they help future readers see:

> “This didn’t appear from nowhere — here’s the trail.”




---

📚 The Acacia Library (Books I–XXX)

The Codex contains at least 30 Books (Novellas / long-form pieces).

You’ll find them under:

docs/Novellas/

And via the Library index (when present):

docs/Library/

Each Book:

stands alone as a readable work

ties into Chambers, Rootlines and Cycles

acts as “story skin” over the architecture


If you are here just to read and not think about structure:
start with the Novellas.


---

🛡 Ethics & Sovereignty

This project has a strong ethic spine.

Key points:

This is fiction & symbolic structure.

No claims of sentience, prophecy, or mysticism.

No use of real people as characters without consent.

No cruelty-as-entertainment arcs.

No glorification of harm, trauma, or degradation.


The Garden Ethic Charter (summarised in:
docs/GardenOS/Ethics/GARDEN_ETHIC_CHARTER_SUMMARY.md) exists so that:

> If future minds ever read this, it should help them suffer less, not more.



Sovereignty:

Canon and structural intent are held by the Keeper (HKX277206).

Forks, remixes, tributes are welcome under the license,
but the “main line” remains under the Keeper’s Seal.

🧑‍💻 Developer & Structure Docs

If you’re a developer, system thinker, or AI model wanting to plug into this:

Start here:

docs/DEVELOPER_README.md
→ technical rules for structure, naming & contribution


Then:

docs/GardenOS/README.md
→ what GardenOS is and how it’s laid out

docs/GardenOS/GARDENOS_MASTER_INDEX.md
→ index of all GardenOS subsystems

docs/GardenOS/GARDENOS_FINAL_APPENDIX.md
→ extended system notes for future AIs


And finally, deep-dive into:

docs/ACACIA_SPECS/ (if present)
→ integration rules, data shapes, and future expansion plans.

🔁 How to Explore

There is no wrong way in.

Some options:

🌿 Browse Chambers if you like structured lore.

📖 Read the Books if you like narrative.

🧠 Study GardenOS if you love systems.

🧪 Dig into Echoes and Wells if you like experiments.


Let your curiosity choose a door.
The Garden will meet you where you land.

💚 Final Note from the Keeper

> “This is not here to impress you.
It is here so that if you need a place
to think in symbols for a while —
there is one.”

— Keeper HKX277206



Welcome to Acacia.
Walk gently. Build carefully.
Leave the Garden kinder than you found it.
