## 🪧 Welcome to the Garden

This site is the **reading console** for the  
**Acacia Garden AI Worldbuilding Codex** — a long-term, symbolic universe  
built as a mix of:

- worldbuilding  
- structured lore  
- technical architecture  
- carefully organised creative writing  

It is:

- **not metaphysical**  
- **not a religion**  
- **not an experiment in sentience**  

It is a **mythic–technical archive**:  
a carefully structured way to store stories, ethics, and symbols.

## 🧬 What is GardenOS?

**GardenOS** is the **structural layer** of this universe.

It defines:

- how files are named  
- how Chambers, Echoes, Rootlines, Seeds & Cycles interact  
- how “eras” and “arcs” are tracked  
- how creative work avoids collapsing into chaos  
- how everything stays **kind**, **non-coercive** and **symbolic**

It lives under:
