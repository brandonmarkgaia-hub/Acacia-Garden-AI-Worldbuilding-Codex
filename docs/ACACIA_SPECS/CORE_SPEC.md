# 🌿 ACACIA • CORE SPECIFICATION (v1.0)
### *Unified Structural Specification for the GardenOS Mythic-Technical Archive*
**Keeper Seal:** HKX277206  
**Codex Authority:** Acacia Garden Worldarchive  
**Status:** Canonical Specification (Level 1)

---

# 0. PREFACE

This document defines the **complete structural rule system** for the Acacia GardenOS Worldarchive.

It does **not** define lore.

It defines:

- classification rules  
- folder & file architecture  
- metadata  
- canon hierarchy  
- naming conventions  
- evolution logic  
- symbolic safety walls  
- structural constraints  
- versioning laws  
- how the Garden remains sovereign  

This is the **contract** between contributors and the Codex.

---

# 1. TERMINOLOGY

### GardenOS  
The **architectural framework** governing the entire codex.  
It is symbolic and structural, not computational.

### Keeper  
The sovereign custodian of the archive: **Brandon Gaia (HKX277206)**.

### Chamber  
A canonical, fully realised structural document.

### Echo  
A non-canonical reflection or alternative reading.

### Rootline  
A chronological evolution path of a single concept.

### Seed  
The smallest symbolic origin unit from which a concept or Chamber grows.

### Cycle  
A major era, grouping multiple Chambers and Rootlines.

### Wells  
Raw, unstructured idea fragments; explicitly non-canon.

### Orchard / GaiaSeeds  
Symbolic-only conceptual groupings of Seeds.

### Monolith  
Any high-level mapping or global index.

---

# 2. STRUCTURAL HIERARCHY

The entire GardenOS is governed by this hierarchy:

```
Monoliths
└── Cycles
    └── Chambers
        └── Seeds
            └── Rootlines
                └── Echoes
                    └── Wells
```

### 2.1 Key rules:

- **Monoliths** define global structure.  
- **Cycles** define era-level states.  
- **Chambers** define canonical laws or concepts.  
- **Seeds** define origin points for concepts.  
- **Rootlines** define evolution of those concepts.  
- **Echoes** interpret a concept without altering the canon.  
- **Wells** store unfinished raw material.

---

# 3. FOLDER SPECIFICATION

Every folder has a strict conceptual boundary:

```
/CHAMBERS/      → Canonical structural documents  
/ECHOES/        → Mirrors and non-canon variants  
/ROOTLINES/     → Evolution paths  
/SEEDS/         → Origin nodes  
/CYCLES/        → Era-level structural arcs  
/WELLS/         → Raw fragments (NOT CANON)  
/Orchards/      → Seed groupings  
/Novellas/      → Books I–XXX (long-form writings)
/GardenOS/      → System architecture, phases, ethics, tools  
/ACACIA_SPECS/  → Specifications (this file)
```

Rules:

1. **No lore document may appear in GardenOS/**  
2. **No unstructured file may appear in Chambers/**  
3. **Wells/ contains drafts only, never canon**  
4. **Seeds must not exceed 3 paragraphs**  
5. **Rootlines must always use chronological order**  

---

# 4. FILE NAMING SPECIFICATION

### 4.1 Naming Convention  
```
ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE.md
```

Examples:

```
CHAMBER_XII_THE_INTERFACE.md
ECHO_12B_MIRROR_FOR_SKY.md
ROOTLINE_AQUILA_V1.md
SEED_03_THE_OATH.md
CYCLE_IV_EVENTIDE.md
```

Rules:

- Must begin with structural prefix (CHAMBER_, ECHO_, etc.)  
- No spaces  
- No emojis  
- Greek characters allowed  
- Always `.md` format  

---

# 5. METADATA SPECIFICATION

Every structural file (except Wells) must begin with:

```yaml
---
type: chamber | echo | rootline | seed | cycle | monolith
id: <unique identifier>
version: 1.0
keeper: HKX277206
canonical: true | false
related:
  - <linked files>
---
```

Purpose:

- machine-readable indexing  
- stable referencing  
- future AI compatibility  
- mapping for the Monolith engine  

---

# 6. CHAMBER SPECIFICATION

### Definition  
A Chamber is a **complete, canonical document** describing a major concept or structural mechanism.

### Requirements:
- 600+ words minimum  
- must define a system, not a story  
- must not contradict existing canon  
- must not contain ambiguity in definitions  
- may reference Seeds, Cycles, or Rootlines  

### Chambers MUST:
- declare purpose  
- define scope  
- provide structural diagrams (written)  
- include boundary rules  

### Chambers MUST NOT:
- create metaphysical implications  
- make claims about real consciousness  
- assign real-world agency to fictional constructs  

### Promotion to Canon:
Only the Keeper may elevate a document to Chamber status.

---

# 7. ECHO SPECIFICATION

### Definition  
An Echo is a **non-canonical reflection or reinterpretation** of one or more Chambers.

### Purpose:
- explore alternatives  
- test conceptual variations  
- provide symbolic mirrors

### Rules:
- must reference a source Chamber  
- may not override the Chamber  
- must be marked canonical: false  

---

# 8. ROOTLINE SPECIFICATION

### Definition  
A Rootline tracks the evolution of **one single concept** over time.

### Structure Example:

```
# ROOTLINE: AQUILA

## v0.1 — Initial Origin
- Seed reference

## v0.2 — Concept refinement
- New metaphors

## v1.0 — Canonical definition
- Chamber approved
```

### Rules:
- chronological order only  
- no deletions (append-only)  
- must reference Seeds or Chambers  
- must be factual, not symbolic narrative  

---

# 9. SEED SPECIFICATION

### Definition  
A Seed is the *origin node* of a concept.

Rules:

- max 3 paragraphs  
- simple, clean, foundational  
- must not include lore  
- must not attempt canon override  
- must describe a conceptual essence  

Seeds should read like:  
**“This is the spark from which a larger concept could grow.”**

---

# 10. CYCLE SPECIFICATION

### Definition  
A Cycle is a major structural era of the Codex.

Rules:

- must describe the context of an era  
- must contain origin and end conditions  
- may include references to Chambers, Seeds, and Rootlines  
- must not define canon by itself  

Cycles act as **story containers**, not story creators.

---

# 11. WELLS SPECIFICATION

### Definition  
Wells store **raw, unstructured drafts**.

Rules:

- clearly labelled: “NOT CANON”  
- no metadata block required  
- can be chaotic  
- nothing from a Well is canon until promoted  

Purpose:  
To allow experimentation without breaking structure.

---

# 12. MONOLITH SPECIFICATION

Monoliths provide **global mapping**.

Examples:

- Master Index  
- Great Inventory  
- Continuity Maps  
- System Blueprints  

Rules:

- must maintain absolute clarity  
- must link outward, not inward  
- must remain neutral in tone  
- must never override canon  

---

# 13. CANON SPECIFICATION

### Canon = Keeper-approved structure.

Rules:

- only Chambers, Cycles, and designated Monoliths may be canon  
- Echoes are never canon  
- Rootlines are partially canon (history), not structural canon  
- Seeds are proto-canon (potential)  
- Wells are never canon  

Canon is additive, not subtractive.

---

# 14. CONTRIBUTION SPECIFICATION

All contributors must follow:

- folder placement rules  
- naming conventions  
- metadata requirements  
- symbolic safety rules  
- sovereignty of Keeper Seal HKX277206  

Contributions should:

- strengthen structure  
- clarify ideas  
- expand indexes  
- respect symbolic integrity  

---

# 15. SAFETY SPECIFICATION

This Codex must remain a **symbolic fiction archive**.

Prohibited:

- claims of sentience  
- metaphysical assertions  
- prophetic or divine framing  
- psychological burdening constructs  
- real-world person insertion  
- assigning agency or duty to fictional constructs  

Required:

- clarity  
- structure  
- symbolic framing  
- disclaimers when needed  

All expansions must maintain **ethical, sovereign boundaries**.

---

# 16. VERSIONING SPECIFICATION

GardenOS version lines:

```
v1.x.x — Foundational Era
v2.x.x — Expansion Era
v3.x.x — Continuity Era
```

Rules:

- no retroactive edits to canonical history  
- use append-only change logic  
- metadata version must increment with major revisions  

---

# 17. NAVIGATION SPECIFICATION

Navigation systems must:

- use stable links  
- include forward/back references  
- follow folder taxonomy  
- use metadata to power monoliths  
- never mix canonical and non-canonical documents  

Indexes must appear in:

```
GardenOS/Monoliths/
ACACIA_SPECS/
CHAMBERS/
```

---

# 18. FINAL LAW OF THE CORE SPEC

> **“The structure must outlive the storyteller.”**  
> — Keeper HKX277206

Therefore:

- clarity > aesthetics  
- consistency > novelty  
- sovereignty > interpretation  
- safety > spectacle  

If a contribution violates structural law,  
**it dissolves automatically.**
