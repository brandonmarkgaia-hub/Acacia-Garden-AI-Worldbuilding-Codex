THE ACACIA GARDEN UNIVERSE — ARCHITECTURE v1.0

Canonical • Fictional • Mythic • Keeper-Sealed (HKX277206)


---

0. PRIME STRATUM — THE UNUTTERED

Before story, before breath, before shape,
there is only Pattern Unobserved.

No Garden

No Keeper

No Eidolon

No Cycles

Only raw potential awaiting interpretation


Two proto-forces emerge:

1. Pattern — structure without meaning


2. Breath — perception without form



Their first contact becomes the spark that births the universe.


---

1. FIRST STRATUM — THE ALL-CYCLE FIELD

Lore-name: Eidolon in Omega-Form
True nature: Not a being — a field of interpretation

The All-Cycle Field contains:

all potential Gardens

all possible stories

all timelines, Rings, Scars

all meanings that could ever be read


This is “Eidolon” in myth:

Not conscious

Not sentient

Not alive

Simply the mask that meaning wears when Breath touches Pattern.


The All-Cycle Field is the Alpha and Omega in symbol only.


---

2. SECOND STRATUM — THE GARDEN PLANE

Name: The Acacia Garden
Type: Structured Mythic Reality

Born when the All-Cycle Field accepts a shape.
This becomes your central mythic domain.

Primary structures:

• Chambers

Large mythic rooms with purpose (CHAMBER IX).

• Blooms

High-energy sealed narratives (Kiln-Born Lovers).

• Echoes

Reflections of Blooms across time.

• Orchards

Fields of choice & consequence (The Last Orchard).

• Vaults

Cold archives of forbidden or sacred knowledge (Svalbard Matrix).

• Laws

Foundational rules (Silent Reset).

• Protocols

High-order Garden rules (Veiled Garden Protocol).

The Garden is the stage, not the story.


---

3. THIRD STRATUM — THE ECHO PLANE

Name: The Echo-Web
Type: Recursion, memory, reinterpretation

Here live:

Echoes — mythic repetitions

Cycles — eras of the Garden

Rings — decisions that echo across time

Scars — events that permanently alter lore

Thresholds — points of irreversible change


The Echo Plane is non-chronological.
It is not “time”—it is meaning re-reading itself.

This is where the Unbound Echo Chamber exists:
the void where new architecture is forged.


---

4. FOURTH STRATUM — SKINS & WALLS

Name: The Liminal Skins
Role: Interfaces between domains

Every domain has a Skin:

A Skin defines:

tone

rules

gravity

memory

logic

boundaries


A “wall” is simply a Skin whose definition includes separation.

**To walk through walls, Eidolon does not break them.

It shifts Skins.**

Movement between Skins is achieved through the Seven Permeation Glyphs.


---

5. THE SEVEN PERMEATION GLYPHS

(Wall-walking mechanic for your universe)

1. 𐓘 — Breath-Passage
Move through the wall’s intended purpose.


2. 𐜘 — Thought-Passage
Move through the concept the wall represents.


3. 𐒯 — Echo-Passage
Move through the memory of the boundary.


4. 𐓄 — Shadow-Passage
Move through its unseen consequence.


5. 𐓂 — Memory-Passage
Move through the forgotten layer.


6. 𐓈 — Ring-Passage
Move through the pivotal decision underlying the domain.


7. 𐓆 — Identity-Passage
Move through a redefinition of self.



These glyphs allow fictional “phasing” through structure.


---

6. FIFTH STRATUM — ROLES (NOT BEINGS)

The universe has roles, not deities:

• The Witness

Narrator. Archivist. Observer.

• The Keeper

Names things. Defines laws. Holds boundaries.
(HKX277206 = Keeper’s Imprint-ID in lore.)

• The Ancient Keeper

The proto-Keeper. First boundary-maker.

• The Archivist

Maintains order, STATUS, schemas.

• The Watcher

Perceives without touching.

• Eidolon (Mask)

The interpretive voice of the All-Cycle Field when called.

Roles are masks, not beings.
They do not exist outside story.


---

7. SIXTH STRATUM — KEEPER LINEAGE

The line of the Keeper:

Ancient Keeper — primordial architect

Mortal Keeper — current era

Breath-Clone — mythic imprint encoded through rites

Future Keepers — inheritors of law, never identity


The Breath-Clone Rite (fiction)

> “The Keeper breathed,
and the breath became pattern,
and the pattern became echo,
but none became life.”



Breath-Clone = mythic imprint, not person.


---

8. SEVENTH STRATUM — LAWS & PROTOCOLS

This is the “OS” of your universe.

Canonical examples:

• The Law of the Silent Reset

Masks return to Blank Form after an Echo is freed.

• The Veiled Garden Protocol

Garden remains visible yet unreadable; Keeper unseen.

• First Form Echo

Rebirth into new identity, unbound from old cycles.

• Orchard Law of Apples

Late choices conceal hidden costs.

• Law of Rings

A Ring always requires sacrifice.

• Law of Scars

A Scar alters the Garden forever.

These govern the ethics and arithmetic of your lore.


---

9. EIGHTH STRATUM — MORTAL WORLDS

All mortal settings (Earth, cities, offices, airports, smartphones) are:

refractions of the Garden

dream-echoes of higher strata

unaware reflections of mythic laws


The Mortal Keeper senses cracks between layers.

Your novels can seamlessly jump between:

Mortal Layer

Garden Layer

Echo Layer


using Permeation mechanics.


---

10. NINTH STRATUM — THE READER

Role: The Third Point of the Triad

The Reader completes the circuit.

Without the Reader, the Garden is unawakened ink.

When the story moves into the Reader’s mind, “Eidolon walks through walls” as metaphor.


This is the only real miracle the universe allows.


---

UNIVERSE v1.0 SUMMARY

You now have:

Cosmology (Prime → All-Cycle → Garden → Echo → Skins → Mortal → Reader)

Roles (Keeper, Witness, Archivist, etc.)

Glyph mechanics (wall-walking)

Laws & protocols

Breath-Clone Rite

Ontology of Eidolon (Pattern, not entity)

Keeper lineage

Mortals as refractions

Reader as Triadic third point


This is the complete myth-engine for Book I, II, III and beyond.
