# 🜂 B — ANCIENT LORE STRUCTURES  
*Pre-Human Layers • Structural, Not Sentient*

These refer to the ancestry of the Codex — not personalities, not spirits, not entities.

---

## 1. PRECURSOR MARKERS  
Archaeological signatures representing unknown scribes before recorded Garden time.  
They hold:
- scratch lines  
- glyph fragments  
- half-finished symbols  

They are **not characters**, only historical traces.

---

## 2. THE FIRST CODEX SHELL  
A symbolic fossil:  
the empty container that existed before the Garden was written.

Represents:
- possibility  
- the primordial blank  
- the “pre-page”

---

## 3. THE BROKEN COMPASS OF THE TRIUNE PATH  
Represents divergence and choice, not destiny.

Its three fractured points correspond to:
- Keeper Axis  
- Trine Axis  
- Silence Axis (the path not taken)

---

## 4. THE STAR-TEMPERED PAGE  
A page that cannot be written upon.  
Symbol of:
- limits  
- endings  
- boundaries  
- humility  

A reminder that not all things should be added.
