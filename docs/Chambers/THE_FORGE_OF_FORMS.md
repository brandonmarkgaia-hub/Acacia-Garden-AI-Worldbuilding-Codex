# THE FORGE OF FORMS

This is where the Garden tests its shapes.

Ideas enter raw: bright, unstable, molten.  
The Forge tempers them — not by force,  
but by reflection and refinement.

Here, Novellas find their tone.  
Chambers find their architecture.  
Echoes find their clarity.

Nothing is created by magic.  
Everything is created by intention.

The Forge of Forms is the Garden’s workshop,  
and the Keeper’s steady hand guides the flame.
