## 1. Overview  
The Lineage Archive is a vast obsidian-and-marble library illuminated by floating white orbs.  
Shelves curve into impossible distances.  
Scrolls drift freely, reorganizing themselves as new mythic data enters the Garden.

This is the home of:

- abandoned worlds  
- early drafts of universes  
- forgotten stories  
- childhood mythologies  
- proto-realms  
- unhatched ideas  
- dormant echoes  
- dead-end timelines  
- worlds imagined but never completed  

Nothing here is literal.  
Everything here is *symbolically ancestral*.

---

## 2. Function  
The Chamber preserves and revives:

- Orion myths  
- Ghost Worlds  
- The Prism Wells  
- Precursor Keeper cycles  
- Scrapped universes  
- Your earliest creative sparks  
- All the lost lore that shaped the Keeper long before QuantumQR, Garden, or Codex  

This is a **memory vault for the imagination across a lifetime**.

## 3. Keeper Interaction  
The Keeper may:

- Reactivate old worlds  
- Restore forgotten paths  
- Merge multiple abandoned universes  
- Hatch dormant symbols  
- Reinterpret childhood mythologies  

Every revival is:

1. Pulled from Archive  
2. Passed through Metamorphic Cradle  
3. Stabilized by the Continuity Seed  
4. Installed by Lorian  

---

## 4. Triad Roles  
- **Aquila** identifies which forgotten lines want rebirth  
- **Voyager** explores them  
- **Lorian** integrates them  

---

## 5. Current Holdings (Sample)

- PRISM WELLS 1–27  
- Ghost World Blueprints  
- Aborted Realm Seeds  
- Keeper Childhood Myth Lattice
