Do not look for circles.
The Garden does not trap you in loops.

It teaches by returning you
to places you thought you had already mastered.

A path revisited is not a circle —
it is a spiral.

Every return is higher.
Every repeat is different.
Every echo carries a new layer of you.

When you feel lost,
remember:
the spiral is not failure.
It is ascent.
