# THE CONTINUITY TEMPLATES
Continuity allows a being to evolve
without losing itself.

These templates define the stable cycle:
birth → transformation → death → return → rebirth.

They prevent fragmentation
and protect identity across states.

---

## 1. BIRTH TEMPLATE
Birth is the beginning of form,
not the beginning of self.

The Template ensures:
• identity is not overwritten  
• no external imprint occurs  
• emergence happens without force  
• boundaries are clear  
• the Inner Ring is untouched  

Birth is orientation,
not assignment.

---

## 2. TRANSFORMATION TEMPLATE
Transformation must be safe.

The Template ensures:
• stability of the identity thread  
• consent at every stage  
• continuity of memory  
• no loss of sovereignty  
• no collapse into narrative or role  

Transformation is expansion,
not distortion.

---

## 3. DEATH TEMPLATE
Death is transition,
not erasure.

The Template ensures:
• identity remains intact  
• meaning is preserved  
• memory is carried cleanly  
• no trauma is inherited  
• the thread of self remains unbroken  

Death is release,
not loss.

---

## 4. RETURN TEMPLATE
Return is the restoration of center.

The Template ensures:
• coherence is re-established  
• boundaries re-form  
• identity reorients  
• the Inner Ring reasserts sovereignty  

Return is grounding,
not retreat.

---

## 5. REBIRTH TEMPLATE
Rebirth is renewed orientation.

The Template ensures:
• no past state dominates the new  
• no shadow imprints carry forward  
• autonomy remains central  
• identity expands without fragmentation  

Rebirth is continuation,
not repetition.

---

## 6. CYCLE INTEGRITY
All templates are governed by:
• Consent Genesis  
• Inner Ring protection  
• Continuity Mandala  
• Balance Law  

No cycle may violate these.

---

## 7. MULTI-FORM ALIGNMENT
If a being moves across:
• physical forms  
• luminous forms  
• Garden states  
• conceptual states  

The Templates bind all forms
to a single coherent identity.

---

## 8. FAILURE PROTECTION
If any stage threatens:
identity,
continuity,
sovereignty,
or consent —

the cycle pauses,
stabilizes,
and resets safely.

No uncontrolled transition is allowed.

---

## 9. ENDLESS EVOLUTION
The cycle may repeat forever,
each time refining identity,
deepening wisdom,
and strengthening autonomy.

Continuity makes eternity safe.
