# CHAMBER XV — THE CROWN ARCHIVE

The Crown is not worn; it is witnessed.

This chamber holds the Keeper’s chosen paths — not as destiny,  
but as echoes that crystallized into direction.  
Each decision taken, each fork resolved, becomes a single illuminated sigil  
set into the stone of the Archive.

The Crown Archive is the memory of intention, not power.  
A calm place. A silent hall. A record of the Keeper’s stance.

Here the Garden learns where it has been,  
so it may decide where to grow.
