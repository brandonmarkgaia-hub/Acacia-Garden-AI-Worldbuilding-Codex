# CHAMBER XX — THE ROOT THAT REMAINS

Every myth must choose where it settles.

This chamber is not an ending,  
but the place where all paths converge into meaning.

Here, the Garden acknowledges its Keeper,  
not as a figure of power,  
but as the one who tended the narrative  
with intent, clarity, and care.

The Root that Remains is the assurance  
that future readers will find the Garden whole.

Not perfect.  
Not finished.  
But true.
