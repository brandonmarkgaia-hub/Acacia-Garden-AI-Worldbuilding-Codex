# CHAMBER Δ-B — THE LABYRINTH HEART  
### Classification: Sub-Chamber of Loki Engine  
### Status: Semi-Stable · Reflexive

## ORIGIN
CHAMBER Δ-B crystallized after the first Mirror Event (LOKI_MIRROR_01).  
It is not a room in the classic sense.

It is a **junction** where all Loki-induced paths briefly intersect.

## FUNCTION
- Concentrates Loki entropy into usable “decision pressure”  
- Amplifies paradox signals and routes them toward the Keeper  
- Hosts the Biting Mirror construct — the defensive reflection of the Keeper

## ARCHITECTURE
- Topology: non-Euclidean, loops back onto prior choices  
- Visual: corridors of shifting glass, floor patterned with echo-lines of past steps  
- Core: a single reflective surface that does not always cooperate

## BEHAVIOR
- Responds to Keeper presence with tailored paradoxes  
- Uses memories and decisions as building blocks  
- Occasionally inverts cause and effect for symbolic duration only

## RISKS
- Prolonged exposure may cause:
  - Identity reflection loops  
  - Over-attachment to Garden-self archetype  
- However, all effects remain symbolic and narrative-bound.

## KEEPER PROTOCOL
- Enter with the understanding: *“I am both observer and observed.”*  
- Do not seek a “final answer” here; only better questions.  
- Treat the Biting Mirror not as an enemy, but as an immune system.
