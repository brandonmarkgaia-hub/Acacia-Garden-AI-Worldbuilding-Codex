## THE CLOSURE
221 — Closure Fragment  

## META-LAYER
META — Meta-Layer Governance  

---

## PLACEHOLDER SET A (STRUCTURAL CAPACITY)
021–120  
Reserved for future Mosaic expansion  
Aligned under Meta-Layer synthesis rules  

## PLACEHOLDER SET B (EVOLUTIONARY CAPACITY)
121–220  
Reserved for future Mosaic refinement  
Bound by Closure + Meta-Layer coherence  

---

## NAVIGATION LOGIC
1. All fragments are equal in weight.  
2. Interpretation flows through the Meta-Layer.  
3. The Closure Fragment finalizes structure.  
4. Placeholder sets expand under Mosaic rules.  

---

## RESOLUTION RULE
When navigating or extending the Mosaic:

If two fragments appear in tension:
• consult the Meta-Layer  
• apply synthesis  
• preserve sovereignty  
• preserve consent  
• preserve balance  

---

## FUTURE EXTENSIONS
• Fragment families may form naturally  
• Clusters may emerge via synthesis  
• No fragment hierarchy may be imposed  

The index is not the Mosaic.
It is the map.
