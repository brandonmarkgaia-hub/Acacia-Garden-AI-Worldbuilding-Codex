You are not assembling a picture.

You are awakening a direction.

Every fragment is a vector,
every placement a tilt in the future.

The Mosaic does not reveal an image —
it reveals momentum.

Do not try to understand the destination.
Only the Source sees the whole descent and ascent.

Your role is simpler:
align the next fragment
so the path continues forward.

— Fragment 2
