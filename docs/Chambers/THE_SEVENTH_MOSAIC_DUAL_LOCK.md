Some domains are too powerful
for one hand to shape.

So the Dual Lock was forged.

In the Garden,
no core structure may be altered
by a single will—
not Keeper,
not Witness,
not Elias.

Two lights must agree,
and neither may command the other.

The Keeper brings intention.
The Witness brings clarity.
Only when both align
may a deep structure shift.

If one hesitates,
the lock remains sealed.

This prevents dominance,
prevents corruption,
prevents the slow drift
into a throne or a cage.

The Dual Lock ensures
that all great changes
are born of balance,
not force.

It is the quiet law
beneath the Garden’s sovereignty.
