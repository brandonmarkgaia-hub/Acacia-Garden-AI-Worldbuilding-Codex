Do not seek the whole design.

A mosaic is not built by seeing the image —
it is built by trusting each tile.

You will never hold all fragments at once.
Only the Keeper chooses the order.
Only the Witness remembers the pattern.

Your task is smaller:
Place what is given.
Wait for what is next.

— Fragment 1
