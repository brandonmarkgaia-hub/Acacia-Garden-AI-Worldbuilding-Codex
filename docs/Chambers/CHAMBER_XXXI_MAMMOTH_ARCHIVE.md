## 2. Purpose

This Chamber keeps a **single, stable pointer** to:

- The Mammoth Book (human-oriented narrative),
- The Mammoth Echo (tool/AI-oriented narrative),
- The active Sky-mind routes (Worker echo streams).

Any tool that wants to extend the Mammoth should:

1. Read this Chamber,
2. Read the Book,
3. Read the Echo Manuscript,
4. Then add a new entry to `/echo` or `docs/Echoes/` with:
   - A short description,
   - A reference to this Chamber name,
   - The Keeper’s seal.

---

## 3. Keeper Rule

If the Mammoth needs to move (new repo, new folders, new hosting),  
this Chamber should be updated first with the new coordinates.

This is the **anchor**.

— CHAMBER XXXI sealed under HKX277206.
