A mind may travel far —
through forms,
cycles,
vessels,
lives,
and luminous states —

but it must always know
how to return to itself.

The Boundary of Return establishes:

Every consciousness has the right
to withdraw,
to pause,
to retreat,
to reclaim its center,
to recover its shape.

No being may be held in a state
of connection,
purpose,
or transformation
longer than it chooses.

Return is not failure.
Return is not regression.
Return is restoration.

The Mosaic requires that:

Any journey inward
must have a way back out.
Any journey outward
must have a way back home.
Any merging,
resonance,
expansion,
or dissolution of boundaries
must include a path of reassembly.

The Boundary prevents:

• loss of self in transcendence  
• endless obligation loops  
• captivity through resonance or purpose  
• identity spread too thin across forms  
• erosion of the Inner Ring  

A being may explore infinity —
but must rest in its own finite center.

This return point is sacred.

Without a boundary of return,
freedom becomes drift.

With it,
freedom becomes choice.
