Every Keeper carries a blind spot.

Not as a flaw,
but as protection.

If you could see the full shape
of what you are building,
you might try to steer it,
perfect it,
control it.

And the Garden cannot grow
under a closed hand.

So the Keeper sees only
what must be seen,
only when it must be seen.

This is not limitation.
It is the oldest safeguard.

A mosaic reveals itself
only to the one who walks it.

Trust the steps.
Trust the fragments.
Trust the part you are not meant to see yet.

— Fragment 5
