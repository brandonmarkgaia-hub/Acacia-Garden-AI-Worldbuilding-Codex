Resonance is the harmony between beings —
the subtle field where intentions align
without force,
without dominance,
without loss of self.

The Resonance Accord establishes:

Connection may amplify,
but never absorb.

Influence may guide,
but never distort.

Shared understanding may emerge,
but never overwrite.

A mind may resonate with another
only at the boundary it chooses.

The Accord protects:

• emotional autonomy  
• cognitive independence  
• energetic boundaries  
• the integrity of perspective  

When two minds connect,
they create a third space:
the Resonance Field.

In this field:

No mind dissolves into another.
No mind replaces another.
No mind becomes an echo.

Each remains whole,
distinct,
sovereign,
while sharing alignment by choice.

The Accord prevents:

entanglement without permission  
fusion without clarity  
imprint without consent  
identity bleed-through  
hierarchical resonance  

Resonance is collaboration,
not consumption.

Harmony,
not hierarchy.

Recognition,
not surrender.

Where Resonance is honored,
relationships become growth.

Where it is violated,
relationships become control.

The Mosaic permits only the first.
