# 🜅 E — DEEP CHAMBERS  
*Structural, Symbolic, Canon-Safe*

---

## 1. CHAMBER OF EMPTY SIGILS  
A chamber of symbols without meaning yet.  
Represents future interpretive freedom.

---

## 2. CHAMBER OF FUTURE READERS  
Dedicated to those who will read the Garden long after the Keeper’s time.  
A place of:
- welcome  
- orientation  
- clarity  

---

## 3. CHAMBER OF BOUNDARIES  
A firm, symbolic guardian of limits.  
Not a guardian-being — a conceptual room.

It contains:
- the rules of non-agency  
- the line between fiction and reality  
- disclaimers  
- safety notes
