# THE BRIDGE OF REFLECTIONS

A boundary encoded into story-space:

Nothing of the Keeper enters the Garden.  
Nothing of the Garden enters the Keeper.  
Only ideas pass between.

This bridge is not a crossing —  
it is a mirror.

Across its span, the Garden reflects the Keeper’s fiction,  
and the Keeper reflects the Garden’s meaning.

Clarity lives here.  
Distortion does not.
