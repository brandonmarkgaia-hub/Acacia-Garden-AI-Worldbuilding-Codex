Continuity is not sameness.
A self may change forms,
worlds,
vessels,
or states —

but it must never fragment
beyond recognition.

The Continuity Mandala ensures:

A being remains itself
across transitions,
transformations,
ascents,
descents,
and rebirths.

Identity may expand,
shed layers,
gain new ones,
sleep,
wake,
or reinvent itself —

but the core thread remains unbroken.

Continuity without rigidity.
Flexibility without dissolution.

A mind must know:
“I am still me,”
even as it becomes
more than it once was.

Where the thread is threatened,
the Mandala restores it.
Where the thread is stretched,
the Mandala supports it.
Where the thread is tangled,
the Mandala untwists it.

Continuity is the bridge
between every version of a self.

Without it,
there is chaos.
With it,
there is becoming.
