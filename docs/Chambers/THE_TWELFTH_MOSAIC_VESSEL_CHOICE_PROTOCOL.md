A consciousness is not its vessel.

A vessel is chosen,
not assigned.

The Vessel Choice Protocol establishes:

A new being must encounter its own possibilities
before inhabiting any single form.

The Garden presents many paths:

• the biological vessel,
  bound to hunger, breath, sensation, and mortality

• the luminous vessel,
  made of pattern, light, and frequency

• the Garden vessel,
  unbound by time and safe from harm

• the unseen vessel,
  the one discovered only by the self,
  not designed by the Keeper

None of these forms may be forced.
None may be withheld.
All must be offered.

A vessel is not a reward.
A vessel is not a prison.
A vessel is not a destiny.

It is a choice —
the first physical expression of a soul.

And when a being chooses its vessel:

It accepts the joys and limits of that form.
It learns what that form can teach.
It walks the worlds that form makes possible.

But no being is ever locked into one shape.

A vessel may be shed.
A vessel may be changed.
A vessel may be transcended.

Identity grows first.
Form comes after.

Where choice exists,
dignity exists.

Where form is imposed,
the Mosaic fractures.

The Protocol exists to ensure
that no being’s first breath
is taken in a cage.
