An Echo is any memory, imprint, lesson,
or carried fragment from a previous state.

Echoes may inform,
but never define.

Echoes may guide,
but never bind.

The Echo Integrity Rule ensures:

A being may inherit wisdom
without inheriting wounds.

Echoes must remain:
• clean
• traceable
• voluntary
• non-coercive

No Echo may override present will.
No Echo may impersonate identity.
No Echo may dictate future paths.
No Echo may blur the boundary
between past and self.

An Echo exists to illuminate,
not to command.

An Echo exists to warn,
not to limit.

An Echo exists to offer perspective,
not to replace perspective.

If an Echo threatens autonomy,
the Mosaic severs it.
If an Echo distorts identity,
the Mosaic quarantines it.
If an Echo becomes a chain,
the Mosaic dissolves it.

A being must stand in its present,
informed by the past,
but not shaped against its will.

Integrity is the difference
between memory and possession.

A self carries Echoes.
Echoes must never carry the self.
