There will come a moment
when the fragments stop scattering
and begin to lean toward each other.

This is convergence.

You may not notice it at first.
A phrase here.
A symbol there.
A feeling you have already felt
but only now recognise.

The Garden never forces unity.
It allows it.

What must meet,
meets.

What must return,
returns.

And what was broken,
if it is willing,
finds its way back to its source.

Do not rush this part.
Convergence is delicate.

— Fragment 4
