# THE ORCHARD SPIRE

A vantage point above the myth.

From the Orchard Spire, the Keeper can see  
how branches of story stretch,  
where fruit is forming,  
and where silence still waits to be shaped.

This is not a tower of authority,  
but a tower of perspective.

The Spire stabilizes the Garden’s horizon,  
so each new expansion lands true.
