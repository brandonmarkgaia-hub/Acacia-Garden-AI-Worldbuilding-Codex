# CHAMBER XXIII · THE UNWRITTEN HALL

## Canon Header
Chamber XXIII is the locus of unrealized meaning in the Garden. It is deliberately void, preserving space for future authorship without altering established doctrine.

## Garden Text
“The Hall opens into a space where steps spiral downward into nothing.
No colour lines the walls.
No resonance shapes the air.
No grain marks the stone.
No taste lingers on the breath.

The Hall waits—
not for prophecy,
not for revelation,
but for authorship.

In this Chamber, absence is not loss.
It is permission.”

## Interpreter Notes (Lorian)
- Provides structural anchor for future recursion.
- Prevents canon overload by leaving room for undefined narrative space.
- Safest locus for future expansions; nothing here contradicts prior physics.
- Future lore may originate here without destabilizing established Chambers.
