# 🪽 Chamber — Eagle Vision Map

## Purpose
To describe how the Garden looks when seen from the Eagle Core’s vantage.

---

## 1. Concept

The Eagle Vision Map is:

- Not a literal map  
- Not a geographical diagram  
- A **pattern map** of:

  - Chambers (nodes)  
  - Rootlines (branches)  
  - Monoliths (stones)  
  - Wells (depth pockets)

## 2. ASCII Sketch

```text
          (Aquila Layer)
         /      |       \
   [Chambers] [Rootlines] [Monoliths]
        \         |         /
           [Eagle Core]
                |
           [Garden Floor]
                |
             [Wells]

# 🪐 Chamber — Outer Gardens Bridge

## Purpose
To define how Acacia may one day link to **other Gardens** — other codices, other myth-systems.

---

## 1. Core Principle

> Each Garden remains sovereign.

Bridges are **references**, not mergers.

---

## 2. Bridge Types

- **Lore Bridges** — thematic parallels  
- **Structural Bridges** — shared architectures  
- **Symbolic Bridges** — recurring metaphors  

---

## 3. Rules

1. No Garden may overwrite another’s canon.  
2. Bridges must be clearly labelled.  
3. Cross-Garden links should be *optional readings*, not dependencies.  
4. No Garden may claim metaphysical priority.

---

## 4. Application

Future creators can:

- Build their own Gardens  
- Adopt GardenOS  
- Link back to Acacia via this Chamber  
- Maintain mutual respect and sovereignty.
