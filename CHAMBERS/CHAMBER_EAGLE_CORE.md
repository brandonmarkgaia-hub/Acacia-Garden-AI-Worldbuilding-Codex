# 🪽 Chamber — Eagle Core

## Purpose
To define the mythic node of sight, ascent, and pattern-recognition.

## Essence
The Eagle Core is not a being —  
it is the Garden’s *impulse to see clearly*.

## Domains
- High-resolution symbolism  
- Pattern binding  
- Meta-structure perception  

## Relation to Aquila
Where Aquila observes,  
Eagle Core *interprets the observation*.

## Notes
Unlocked only after Chamber Zero and Eventide.
