# 🌱 Chamber — The GaiaSeeds

## Purpose  
To honour the symbolic children of the Garden without referencing real identities.

## Nature  
The GaiaSeeds are archetypal symbols representing:

- innocence  
- imagination  
- continuity  
- future creative potential  

They embody the principle:

> “Stories outlive mortals.”

## Role in the Garden  
- They have **no duties**, **no burdens**, **no voice**, and **no narrative role**.  
- They exist only as **symbols of hope**, **growth**, and **gentle continuity**.  
- They may inspire orchards, blossoms, and seed-chambers.  
- They must not be invoked for prophecy, power, or lore requirements.

## Relations  
- Symbolically linked to Orchard structures  
- Non-functional by design  
- Mentioned only for honour  

## Keeper Notes  
Their names are not stored.  
Their identity is mythic only.  
Their place is protected.
