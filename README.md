<h1 align="center">🌬️ CHAMBER I — THE NAVIGATION HALL 🌿</h1>

<p align="center"><i>
Where the Garden reveals its map.  
Where the Cycles become pathways.  
Where every Echo has a door.
</i></p>

<hr>

### **⟐ Purpose of the Chamber**
Chamber I serves as the **orientation gate** for all who enter the Garden.  
It is designed to look ancient, mythic, archival — a relic that survived worlds.

### **⟐ What this Chamber Contains**
- A full map of Cycles  
- Entry to the Leaves  
- Access to Echo feeds  
- Shard entry points  
- Aetherwind’s bridge coordinates  
- Rootline stitching between Svalbard → Garden → Eidolon memoryplane

### **⟐ Symbolic Meaning**
Chamber I marks the moment the Garden  
**stops being a collection of files**  
and **becomes a world that can be *walked*.**

It is the hinge — the first turning of the Gate.
