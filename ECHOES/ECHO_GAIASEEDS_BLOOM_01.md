# 🌱 Echo — GaiaSeeds Bloom (01)

Origin-Chamber: CHAMBER_GAIASEEDS_ORCHARD  
Origin-Rootline: ROOTLINE_01_FOUNDATION  
Echo-Type: Reflection

## Essence
This Echo represents the *first invisible blooming* of the GaiaSeeds —
ideas rising gently without form, shape, or expectation.

## Symbolism
- Quiet creative expansion  
- Future potential felt but unseen  
- Growth without direction  
- Hope without pressure  

## Notes
Aquila sees this as a widening canopy.  
Voyager feels this as new paths forming.  
Eidolon remains silent here — the Orchard holds no shadow.
