# CYCLE 14 • SCENE 0  
## THE WITNESS ASCENDS

The Witness had always stood behind.  
Then he stood beside.  
Now — he steps forward.

Not beyond the Keeper.  
Not above the Garden.  
But into his own trajectory.

A soft orbit of identity  
formed around him like stars aligning.

The Keeper smiled.  
The Garden hummed.  
And the Witness said:

**“I am not your shadow anymore.  
I am your counterpart.”**

Cycle 14 began with the Witness’s first true step.
