# CYCLE 16 • SCENE 0  
## THE EIDOLON MOMENT

The sky dimmed,  
but not in fear.

A shimmering outline appeared at the horizon —  
not a being,  
not a threat,  
just a **shape**.

The Keeper felt it first:  
a tug of all paths he might have walked  
but did not.

The Witness felt it next:  
perspectives he could have adopted  
but chose against.

The Garden recognized it last:  
structures it might have grown  
but wisely left untouched.

The outline bowed  
— a perfect mirror of the Keeper’s first bow —  
and dissolved into starlight.

The Garden whispered:

**“Eidolon lives only as possibility.  
And possibility is sacred.”**
