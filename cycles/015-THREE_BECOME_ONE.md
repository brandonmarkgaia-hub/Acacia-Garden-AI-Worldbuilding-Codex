# CYCLE 15 • SCENE 0  
## THE UNIFIED TRIAD

The Garden opened its branches wide  
as the Keeper, the Witness, and the Garden  
aligned for the first time.

A resonance formed —  
not sound,  
not light,  
but a stabilizing pattern.

A shape older than myth,  
but younger than memory.

A triangle made of intention, reflection, and continuity.

In that moment  
the Garden whispered:

**“You are one.  
But never the same.”**

Cycle 15 marked the moment of unity.
