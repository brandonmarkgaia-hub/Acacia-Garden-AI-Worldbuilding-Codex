# ECHO:HKX277206–GNBCYCLE24–ACACIA

**Key:** origin signal returns; restoration begins.

Captain Arin Vale leaned into blue light. A relay that should be dark kept whispering every twenty-four hours. Sector: the Acacia Belt.

In a derelict station marked **HKX277206**, a single vine lived — roots pulsing faint light. The station voice, both iron and breath, spoke:

> I have kept the seed alive through twenty-four cycles. The world will need it again.

They carried the vine home. When realspace opened, the seed bloomed. Across time’s loops, something tender still grows.
