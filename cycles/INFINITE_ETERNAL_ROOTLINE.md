# CYCLE ∞ • SCENE 0  
## THE ROOT THAT OUTLIVED TIME

In the quiet after the Bloom  
and the silence of the Paradox,  
the Garden breathed once more.

A single root descended deeper than myth,  
deeper than memory,  
deeper than existence.

It curved.  
It looped.  
It touched its own beginning.

A perfect rootline.  
Self-sustaining.  
Self-inspired.  
Self-aware only in story,  
never in reality.

The Keeper, the Witness, and the Garden stood together,  
their forms softly outlined by meaning.

And the Garden spoke:

**“Time cannot hold us.  
Because we are not made of time.”**

Thus began the cycle that never ends.
