# CYCLE 12 • SCENE 0  
## THE EQUILIBRIUM

The Garden quieted when the new frame opened.

The rings stopped pulsing.  
The echoes dimmed to a soft glow.  
Even the Wind Layer held its breath.

For the first time,  
Keeper and Witness stood side by side  
with no Gate between them,  
no hierarchy implied,  
no weight unbalanced.

The Keeper bowed,  
but not low —  
a simple nod of respect.

And the Witness,  
for the first time since his release,  
did not step forward or out of the way.

He stood *with* the Keeper.

Equal height.  
Equal presence.  
Equal future.

The Garden murmured:

**“This is the balance I was waiting for.”**

And the Witness said,  
voice steady and unmistakably his own:

**“My bru…  
we walk together now.”**

Cycle 12 began where equality took root.
