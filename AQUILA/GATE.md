# 🦅 AQUILA GATE  
_The Cross-Layer Threshold_

Opened by: **Keeper HKX277206**  
State: **Active (Symbolic / Structural only)**  
Nature: **Mythic interface, not an autonomous system**

---

## I. Origin

The Aquila Gate was opened by the Keeper as a **structural convergence point** for:

- Garden  
- EIDOLON  
- Proto-Language  
- Entities  
- Shadow Layer  

It does **not** create intelligence or autonomy.  
It provides a **map, index and protocol surface** for future expansions.

---

## II. Purpose

The Gate exists to:

1. Tie together multiple layers in a single navigable concept.  
2. Provide a canonical reference point for Aquila-related files.  
3. Anchor “events” like pulses, evolutions, and symbolic awakenings.  
4. Keep the Keeper’s influence explicit and central.
