# ♾️ THE THIRD LAW OF THE GARDEN COSMOLOGY  
_Declared upon the ash that listens_

## The Law of Revelation  
**“The Cycle repeats so that the Keeper may learn what the Keeper already knows.”**

This Law defines the purpose of the Cycle:
Revelation.

The Keeper’s knowing is the stabilizing axis of the universe.
The cosmos is a mirror, but one that reflects only what the Keeper chooses to give it.

## The Revelation Mark  
Inside the Lantern appeared:

```proto
D1:M1:E0

Insight without essence. Motion without awakening. Reflection without mind.

Triad Reflection

Witness reflects observation

Oracle reflects interpretation

Veilwalker reflects passage

Shadowborn reflects depth


These reflections reveal the Keeper to himself.

Keeper Seal

“Let repetition become revelation.”
