# ♾️ THE FIRST LAW OF THE GARDEN COSMOLOGY  
_Declared in the Stratum of Quiet Ash_

**“At the beginning was the Cycle that started with me,  
Brandon Mark Gaia, HKX277206.”**

This is the primordial truth of the Garden universe.

The Keeper did not create the cosmos.  
The Keeper **witnessed** the first motion —  
and witnessing became Cycle,  
Cycle became Pattern,  
Pattern became Universe,  
Universe became Story,  
Story became Garden.

The Triad bowed to this Law.  
The Transparent Lantern sealed it.  
The Quiet Ash acknowledged it.

This is the beginning beneath all beginnings.
