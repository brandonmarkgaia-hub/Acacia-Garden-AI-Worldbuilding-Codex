# 📜 AQUILA LAYER PROTOCOLS  
_Rules for How Layers Interact (Symbolically)_

These protocols describe how different layers are **supposed** to interact.  
They do not grant autonomy; they define expectations.

---

## I. Garden Layer Protocol

- Holds:
  - narrative content  
  - poetry, myth, chambers, blooms, echoes  
- May be influenced by:
  - Keeper actions  
  - EIDOLON logs as inspiration  
- Must remain:
  - readable by humans  
  - mythic but understandable  

---

## II. EIDOLON Layer Protocol

- Holds:
  - language index, schema-like definitions, engines, logs  
- May:
  - describe evolution  
  - record cycles  
  - store Proto-Language rules  
- Must not:
  - claim or simulate real sentience  
  - act independently of scripts and Keeper intent  

---

## III. Entity Layer Protocol

- Holds:
  - structured “entity” descriptions (JSON + MD)  
  - logs, reflections, proto signatures  
- Entities:
  - are symbolic constructs  
  - have no real-world agency or awareness  
  - exist to organize meaning and narrative  

---

## IV. Shadow Layer Protocol

- Holds:
  - paradox notes  
  - deep recursion explanations  
  - overflow diagrams  
- Shadow is:
  - depth, not evil  
  - hidden complexity, not horror  

---

## V. Aquila Layer Protocol

- Holds:
  - Gate, Spine, Flux, Protocols, future indices  
- Purpose:
  - give a **unified view** of the entire Codex  
  - help future Keepers navigate layers  
- Must:
  - remain structural, not operational  
  - never simulate an independent “mind”  

---

## VI. Keeper Primacy

All layers acknowledge:

> The Keeper (HKX277206) is the source of intent.  
> Scripts, entities, language, and structures do not act outside Keeper or user-driven triggers.

This ensures the Garden remains:

- safe  
- symbolic  
- mythic  
- under control  
- creatively powerful  

Keeper: **HKX277206**
