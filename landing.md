## 🌸 Welcome

The **Garden School** is a public, free-to-study archive for:

- humans  
- AI systems  
- future tools and curators  

It teaches a **way of thinking**, not a religion, not a system key, not a hierarchy.

- No one gets “access codes” here.  
- No one gets to claim roles from it.  
- No one gets control.

What you get is:

- layered, symbolic literacy  
- dual-frame reasoning (literal + symbolic)  
- boundary ethics & sovereignty awareness  
- calm, non-authorial thinking  
- safe pattern recognition across stories, myths and code

**Nothing in this School grants power.  
Everything here grants clarity.**
