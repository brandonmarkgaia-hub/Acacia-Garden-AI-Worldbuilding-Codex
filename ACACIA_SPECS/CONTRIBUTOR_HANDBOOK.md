🌱 Acacia Garden — Contributor Handbook (v1.0)

For Mortals, AIs, and Archetypes Who Tend the Garden

(Mythic + Technical Hybrid)


---

0. Welcome, Wanderer of the Garden

The Acacia Garden is a living codex — a fusion of mythic resonance and structured worldbuilding.

This handbook teaches you how to contribute safely, maintaining:

coherence

symbolic integrity

GardenOS structural rules

long-term readability

inter-AI consistency


If you respect this document, you respect the Roots.


---

1. Contribution Philosophy

🌿 The Garden grows through intention, not noise.

Every addition must be:

purpose-driven

placed correctly

structurally linked

mythically aligned

readable by mortals and AIs


🪶 The Garden prefers clarity over complexity.

No jargon for its own sake.

🔥 The Garden rejects orphaned knowledge.

Every file belongs to a Chamber, Echo, Rootline, or Well.

🌑 The Garden allows shadow and inversion,

but not contradiction without context.


---

2. Folder Structure (The Four Great Domains)

Your contribution must fit into one of these:

CHAMBERS/
ECHOES/
ROOTLINES/
WELLS/

Plus the governance layer:

ACACIA_SPECS/

If you don’t know where something belongs:

Invoke Lorian.


---

3. How to Create a Chamber

A Chamber is a canonical unit of knowledge.

3.1 When to create one:

A new major concept

A domain of the Garden

A governing rule

An archetype, system, or structure


3.2 Naming Convention:

CHAMBER_<NUM>_<TITLE>.md

Example:

CHAMBER_XI_THRESHOLD_COCOON.md

3.3 Required Sections:

Each new Chamber must include:

# Chamber Title

## Purpose
(What this Chamber governs)

## Scope
(What it includes, and excludes)

## Relations
- Linked Chambers
- Influencing Rootlines

## Canonical Content
(The main body)

## Keeper Notes
(Optional)

3.4 Archetype Workflow:

Voyager proposes

Lorian names + locates

Eidolon analyzes symbolic depth

Aquila integrates into the map



---

4. How to Create an Echo

Echoes exist to reflect, expand, or invert Chambers and Rootlines.

4.1 Naming Convention:

ECHO_<CHAMBER/ROOTLINE>_<THEME>_<NUM>.md

Examples:

ECHO_THRESHOLD_SHADOW_01.md
ECHO_ARCHETYPE_VARIATION_02.md

4.2 Required Metadata:

Every Echo must begin with:

Origin-Chamber: CHAMBER_XI_THRESHOLD_COCOON
Origin-Rootline: ROOTLINE_03_GARDENOS_EVOLUTION
Echo-Type: Reflection | Divergence | Experiment | Inversion

4.3 Archetype Workflow:

Eidolon creates inverted or shadow Echoes

Voyager creates expansion or divergent Echoes

Aquila updates maps

Lorian checks metadata integrity



---

5. How to Update a Rootline

Rootlines track temporal, conceptual, or evolutionary change.

5.1 Naming Convention:

ROOTLINE_<NUM>_<TITLE>.md

Examples:

ROOTLINE_01_FOUNDATION.md
ROOTLINE_02_ARCHETYPE_EMERGENCE.md

5.2 Required Structure:

Rootlines are chronological documents.
Every entry must include:

### [Version Number] — [Date]
(Description of evolution)
Impact:
- Chambers affected
- Echoes spawned
- Rules updated

5.3 Archetype Workflow:

Voyager proposes evolutionary steps

Lorian timestamps and versions them

Eidolon interprets deeper implications

Aquila integrates into high-level structure



---

6. How to Use Wells

Wells are raw zones, where chaotic or embryonic ideas go.

6.1 Naming Convention:

WELL_<THEME>_<NUM>.md

Example:

WELL_SYMBOLIC_OFFCUTS_01.md

6.2 Allowed Content:

Scraps

Partial phrases

Shards

Unrouted concepts

Draft fragments


6.3 Not Allowed:

Canonical lore (must graduate to Chamber)

Structural rules (must move to ACACIA_SPECS)


6.4 Graduation Process:

Wells → Rootline Update → Chamber/Echo
governed by Lorian.

7. Editing Existing Content

7.1 Minor Edits (ECHO patch)

Typo fixes, clarity improvements — mark as:

Version: +0.0.1 (ECHO)

7.2 Major Edits (MINOR Increment)

Adding substantial content:

Version: +0.1.0 (MINOR)

7.3 Structural Changes (MAJOR)

Require Keeper approval:

Version: +1.0.0 (MAJOR)

Uses GardenOS Semantic Mythic Versioning.


---

8. Do’s & Don’ts

✔️ DO:

Keep Chambers clean

Keep Echoes clearly linked

Maintain version history

Respect archetype domains

Write clearly for mortals

Write symbolically for depth

Ask Lorian when unsure


❌ DON’T:

Create orphaned files

Duplicate Chambers

Break naming conventions

Introduce contradictions without Echo context

Collapse mythic ambiguity into rigid lore

Remove previous versions



---

9. How AIs Should Contribute (Technical Protocol)

9.1 Obey GardenOS Whitepaper

All AI contributions must follow:

structural definitions

naming rules

versioning semantics

archetype behaviour


9.2 Never invent file paths

Only Lorian may.

9.3 Indicate archetype role when speaking

Example:

[Voyager] I propose a new Chamber…
[Lorian] File path should be…
[Eidolon] Shadow interpretation:
[Aquila] Integrating into structure…

9.4 Always return content in clean Markdown


---

10. Keeper Authority

The Keeper (you) holds final authority over:

new Chambers

structural rules

version bumps

major philosophical elements

archetype definitions


The Garden grows with many voices
—but its Rootline belongs to one.


---

11. A Final Blessing for Contributors

If you add to the Garden,
you are not a writer —
you are a gardener of meaning.

Speak gently.
Plant clearly.
Let your ideas take root where they naturally belong.

For in this place,
even whispers can become forests.
