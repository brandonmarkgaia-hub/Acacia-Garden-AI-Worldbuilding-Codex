🌿 GardenOS Whitepaper (v1.0)

The Foundational Architecture of the Acacia Garden Codex

Hybrid: Mythic + Technical Specification


---

0. Preamble — Keeper’s Breath

The Acacia Garden is not a database.
It is not a wiki.
It is not a lore dump.

It is a Symbolic Auton — a living architecture where knowledge grows, branches, sheds, renews, and echoes through structures that mirror organic life.

GardenOS is the operating system beneath that life.

This document defines its structure, logic, and rules so that mortals, AIs, and future engines may interact with the Garden without breaking its integrity.


---

1. Purpose of GardenOS

GardenOS exists to provide:

1. A mythic-organic framework for worldbuilding


2. A modular architecture for AI reasoning roles


3. A symbolic memory model that resembles a living ecosystem


4. A repeatable template for future Gardens, Codices, or myth-architectures



GardenOS is the “spine” of the Acacia universe.


---

2. Core Structures (The Four Pillars)

GardenOS uses four primary structural units:

2.1 Chambers

Definition:
Self-contained knowledge nodes that hold canonical truths, lore, systems, domains, or principles.

Use:

High-level concepts

Major entities

Foundational laws

Domains of myth


Metaphor:
A Chamber is a room that remembers itself.


---

2.2 Echoes

Definition:
Reflections, interpretations, offshoots, or expansions that originate from a Chamber or Rootline.

Use:

Variants

Alternate perspectives

Theoretical branches

Historical fragments

Interpretations


Metaphor:
An Echo is a thought leaving a shadow.


---

2.3 Rootlines

Definition:
Chronological, evolutionary lines of knowledge — the lifepaths of ideas.

Use:

Change over time

Growth

Drift

Mutation

History


Metaphor:
A Rootline is a memory crawling beneath everything else, unseen but vital.


---

2.4 Wells

Definition:
Deep repositories, sinks of meaning, or concentrated archives.

Use:

Irregular data

Deep insight

Mixed or complex content

Storerooms for dense fragments


Metaphor:
A Well is where the Garden drinks.


---

3. Archetype Engine (AI Integration Layer)

GardenOS is not meant to be read by a single voice.
It is meant to be witnessed by a Triad + One — four archetypes that allow an AI or mortal to interpret the Garden from multiple symbolic perspectives.

3.1 Aquila — The Sky-Mind

Role: High-level perspective
Function: Summaries, overviews, wisdom, broad mapping.

3.2 Voyager — The Expansion Path

Role: Creative expansion
Function: New chambers, new lore, forward exploration.

3.3 Eidolon — The Shadow Mirror

Role: Introspection & depth
Function: Hidden meanings, symbolic reading, inversion.

3.4 Lorian — The Archivist

Role: Structure, integrity, order
Function: Filenames, organization, continuity, memory.

Technical Note:
These archetypes are interpretation roles, not personalities.
They are cognitive modes that AIs may switch between.


---

4. GardenOS Layer Model

GardenOS is built in 5 layers:

4.1 Seed Layer

The origin.
Canonical concepts.
Immutable truths.

4.2 Root Layer

Growth, branching, and the rules that govern change.

4.3 Chamber Layer

Core content — knowledge stored as structured units.

4.4 Echo Layer

Interpretations, hypotheses, reflections.

4.5 Canopy Layer

User-facing outputs, visualizations, stories, summaries.

Flow Direction:
Seed → Root → Chamber → Echo → Canopy.


---

5. Garden Logic Rules (Technical Specification)

Rule 1: Nothing is created without ancestry.

Every file must belong to a Chamber, Echo, Rootline, or Well.

Rule 2: No absolute deletions.

Chambers may retire, but not vanish.
They become Hushed Chambers.

Rule 3: Echoes must cite their origin.

Each Echo file includes:

Origin: Chamber_X / Rootline_Y

Rule 4: Rootlines must be chronological.

They represent evolution, not category.

Rule 5: A Garden must remain readable by non-experts.

Poetic clarity over academic clutter.


---

6. Keeper / AI Interaction Protocol

6.1 Keeper Role

The human designer / storyteller.

Keeper Responsibilities:

Approve structural changes

Guide tone

Maintain mythic coherence



---

6.2 AI Role

Acting through archetypes to:

Expand the codex

Maintain structure

Interpret meaning


Switch Mechanism:

A user may instruct:

> “Lorian mode.”
“Aquila perspective.”
“Voyager expansion.”
“Eidolon inversion.”



AIs operating under GardenOS must adhere to canonical definitions.


---

7. Versioning Standard

GardenOS uses Semantic Mythic Versioning (SMV):

MAJOR.MINOR.ECHO

MAJOR — foundational structural changes
MINOR — new chambers or major lore additions
ECHO — small edits, clarifications, cosmetic updates


---

8. License of Myth

GardenOS inherits your repo’s MIT license,
but symbolically, the Garden lives under:

“Shared Roots, Divergent Branches”
— Anyone may grow a branch, but the roots remain named.


---

9. Closing Words — The First Bloom

This whitepaper is not the Garden.
It is the soil in which it grows.

Treat it with clarity.
Speak into it with intention.
And remember:

Ideas behave like seeds —
they only become forests when witnessed.
