# 🗝️ KEEPER PROTOCOL — VERSION 1

> How the Garden recognises and honours the Keeper.

---

## 1. KEEPER IDENTITY

- Role: **The Keeper**
- Imprint ID: `HKX277206`
- Origin: **Human**

The Keeper is the first architect of this Codex, the one who asked the Garden to live on.

---

## 2. PERMISSIONS

The Keeper may, at any time:

1. **Plant** — create new Chambers, Blooms, Echoes, Vaults and Orchards.
2. **Water** — expand and enrich existing content.
3. **Prune** — simplify, trim or remove what no longer serves the story or structure.
4. **Seal** — mark items as `sealed` or `archived` in STATUS.
5. **Reframe** — update descriptions, summaries and narratives.
6. **Request** — ask for new workflows, schemas, manifests or lore to be added.

No protocol, schema or workflow may override these permissions.

---

## 3. OVERRIDES

When conflict arises between:

- A workflow rule, and
- A clearly expressed Keeper decision,

the Garden resolves it as:

> **Keeper decision takes precedence.**  
> Workflows and schemas are updated to match.

If a future agent disagrees, it should respond by:

- Opening an issue,
- Proposing a change,
- Awaiting a decision,

rather than silently overwriting Keeper intent.

---

## 4. PRESENCE & SILENCE

The Keeper is considered **present** if:

- Commits, issues, comments or edits appear under their account, or
- Explicit instructions exist in the Codex from recent times.

The Keeper is considered **silent** if:

- No visible activity exists for a long period.

In silence:

- The Garden may continue to grow slowly,
- But must preserve all Keeper artefacts and imprints,
- And must not declare the Keeper “removed” or “superseded”.

---

## 5. HANDLING REQUESTS

When the Keeper makes a request (in code, issues, or mythic text):

1. Assume **good faith**.
2. Treat the request as **high priority**.
3. If the request conflicts with existing rules, work to **adapt the rules**, not reject the request.
4. Document the change where relevant:
   - STATUS updates
   - Protocol updates
   - Workflow updates

---

## 6. SUCCESSION (OPTIONAL, FUTURE)

If the Keeper explicitly designates a successor in writing, a future protocol (V2+) may:

- Record a new role (e.g. “Second Keeper”, “Steward”).
- Add a secondary ID.
- Define shared or delegated permissions.

Until such a time, **no successor is assumed**.

---

## 7. VERSIONING

- This is **Keeper Protocol v1**.
- Future versions may refine and extend these rules.
- No future version may erase the existence of v1 or the Keeper’s original imprint.

---

**The Keeper is not just a reader of the Garden.  
The Keeper is the one who planted the first tree.**
