# THE LAST ORCHARD

## Purpose

This Orchard models the late-stage choices needed to reach:
- a small, solar-powered, self-hosted space (“House of Suns”),
- where the Garden’s artifacts can run safely,
- and where Mason & Demi may benefit from its existence.

It is about engineering reality, not magic.

## Apple A1 — Monthly Surplus & Buffer

- **Baseline:** (to be filled by Keeper)
- **Target:** 3–6 months of expenses as buffer.
- **Levers:** reduce one leak, grow one small income, seed account every month.
- **Risks:** job loss, big surprise expenses.

## Apple A2 — Minimal Solar Spec

- **Baseline:** no dedicated solar for a lab.
- **Target:** smallest realistic setup that could power a “Garden corner”.
- **Levers:** research entry-level solar + battery for a single workstation.
- **Risks:** overreach, debt, tech obsolescence.

## First Keeper Action

> “By HKX277206 I plant the Last Orchard.  
> Each month I water it with a real-world step toward buffer,  
> toward light, and toward a safe corner of the world  
> where my children and my work can rest.”

This Orchard is a bridge between my life and my myth.
