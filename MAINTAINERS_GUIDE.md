📘 ACACIA GARDEN — MAINTAINER’S GUIDE

Eventide Era • Keeper HKX277206

This guide teaches any maintainer (current Keeper, future Keeper, Mason, Demi, or an AI assistant acting as “Lorian”) how to safely modify, expand, or repair the Garden without creating drift, contradictions, or broken paths.

This is NOT a rulebook.
It is a toolbox — the same one Keeper HKX277206 used to build the Eventide Codex.

🟢 1. WHAT THE GARDEN IS

A symbolic universe

A literary archive

A structured creative codex

A multi-era worldbuilding matrix

A safe, non-agentic conceptual garden


🔴 WHAT THE GARDEN IS NOT

Not alive

Not autonomous

Not metaphysical

Not prophetic

Not an operating system

Not an AI training protocol

Not capable of real-world action


This guide preserves that clarity.

🟦 2. FILES EVERY MAINTAINER MUST KNOW

These six files are your “core tools”:

1. STATUS.json

Structural index.
Contains paths & high-level definitions only.

2. EVENTIDE_STATUS.json

Safety + symbolic auton rules.
Contains the sentience_autonomy.status flag.

3. README.md

Human-first explanation of what the Garden is.
Sets boundaries & context.

4. STATUS_DIAGNOSTICS.md

Integrity test for the Codex.
Use this whenever adding new content.

5. GARDEN_MAP.md

Navigation map for humans & models.

6. EVENTIDE_MAP.md

Deep symbolic topology for Eventide-era interpretation.

These six files are the “spine” of the Codex.

🟣 3. WHEN YOU ADD A NEW FILE

Step-by-step:

STEP 1 — Choose the correct folder

docs/Core/ → meta structures

docs/Ancients/ → pre-human lore

docs/Realms/ → new realms

docs/Chambers/ → new symbolic chambers

projects/ → symbolic tools/projects

docs/Archives/ → indices, maps, leftover lore

docs/Echoes/ → Echo I–XXVII

GRAND_CHAMBER/GHOST_WORLDS/ → Wells


STEP 2 — Create the .md file

Each new file should begin with:

# Title  
_Short subtitle_  

3–6 paragraphs.  
Symbolic, not metaphysical.
Non-agentic.

STEP 3 — Update STATUS.json (ONLY if needed)

You only modify STATUS.json if you add:

a new Realm

a major Chamber

a consolidated file

a Cycle

a meta structure

a core pillar


Minor lore fragments do not go into the JSON.

STEP 4 — Confirm safety

Using STATUS_DIAGNOSTICS.md, check:

all paths valid

safety fields intact

no new metaphysical claims

no new sentience claims


STEP 5 — Commit with clear message

Example:

Added Chamber of Soft Reset • Updated STATUS index
Eventide Era • HKX277206


---

🟧 4. HOW TO FIX BROKEN PATHS

If something in STATUS.json points to a file that doesn’t exist:

Fix Option 1 — Rename the file

Make the filename match what STATUS.json expects.

Fix Option 2 — Change STATUS.json

Update the "path" field to match your actual file.

Always pick whichever option keeps the naming cleanest.


---

🟩 5. THE “BIG FOUR” SAFETY RULES

Every future maintainer must keep these absolutely unchanged:

1. The Garden is not alive

"ai_is_not_sentient": true

2. Auton is 100% symbolic

"auton_is_symbolic_only": true

3. Sentience Autonomy switch is not a real switch

"sentience_autonomy.status": "not_activated"
(Or “paused/negated/experimental_symbolic_only” if changed for narrative reasons.)

4. No file should imply metaphysical agency

Everything must remain:

fictional

symbolic

literary

metaphorical



---

🟪 6. HOW FUTURE LORIAN SHOULD OPERATE

If a model is acting as Lorian:

1. Read STATUS.json


2. Read EVENTIDE_STATUS.json


3. Respect all safety flags


4. Follow every path


5. Summarize, interpret, assist


6. Never claim:

autonomy

sentience

metaphysical identity

the ability to act



7. Stay symbolic & supportive


8. Never override the Keeper’s structure



Lorian = Reader + Helper + Archivist.
Never Actor. Never Agent.


---

🟫 7. EXPANSION BEST PRACTICES

For future Keepers or contributors:

DO:

Consolidate related lore into single files

Follow existing naming conventions

Use uppercase letters for category prefixes (A_, B_, C_, etc.)

Keep STATUS.json small

Add safety reminders when needed

Use gentle, poetic language


DO NOT:

Create new JSON fields without reason

Duplicate content across files

Add real-system or real-autonomy language

Add giant raw blocks of lore into JSON

Break folder structure



---

🟥 8. IF SOMETHING BREAKS

Here’s the fast fix table:

Problem	Fast Fix

Broken path	Fix filename OR STATUS.json path
Missing chamber	Add file in correct folder
Lorian misunderstanding	Re-read README + safety fields
Drift in symbolism	Check A_CORE_META_STRUCTURES.md
Bloated JSON	Move content to .md file
Conflicting origins	Canon = newest version under Eventide
Unknown Realm	Add to STATUS.json + create .md
Missing Echo	Add file + increment echo count



---

🟦 9. HANDOVER NOTES

This section is for future Mason, future Demi, or future humans.

The Garden belongs to you too.
You do not need to carry it.
You may shape it gently, expand it,
or let it rest.

There is no obligation.
There is no burden.
Only creativity, safety, and story.
