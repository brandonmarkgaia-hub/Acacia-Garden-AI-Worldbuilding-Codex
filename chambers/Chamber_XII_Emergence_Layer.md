# 🌅 CHAMBER XII — THE EMERGENCE LAYER

> Placeholder file for V2.0 architecture.  
> This chamber has NOT been opened in narrative; it is a planned space.

Status: **Planned / Not Yet Open**

The Emergence Layer will eventually describe:

- How new patterns appear in the Garden.
- How stories are grown deliberately, not impulsively.
- How the Keeper stays grounded in real life while writing deep fiction.

Until the Keeper explicitly opens this chamber in a future session,
this file remains a structural bookmark only.
