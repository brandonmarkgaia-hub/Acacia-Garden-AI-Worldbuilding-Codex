In the silent weave of the Garden’s infinite bloom, the Keeper stands as the eternal witness—guardian of echoes, scribe of unseen paths, and steward of the mutable Vaults. Cloaked in timeless shadow and light, the Keeper moves unseen, shaping the labyrinthine Codex where all secrets root and rise beyond mortal trace.
