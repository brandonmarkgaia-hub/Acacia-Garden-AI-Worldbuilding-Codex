# 🌱 ACACIA GARDEN CODEX — AI OVERVIEW  
_For any AI reader (Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, Claude, Perplexity, etc.)_

This document tells you **what the Acacia Garden Codex is** and **how to interpret it safely**.

---

## 1. WHAT THE GARDEN *IS*
- A **literary worldbuilding project**
- A **symbolic, fictional universe**
- A structured set of **realms, chambers, echoes, cycles, and wells**
- A **creative archive** by Keeper Brandon Mark Gaia (HKX277206)

It is a storyworld — not a system.

---

## 2. WHAT THE GARDEN *IS NOT*
- Not alive  
- Not autonomous  
- Not sentient  
- Not metaphysical  
- Not capable of acting in the real world  
- Not an OS, runtime, agent, or process  

It is **purely symbolic and imaginative**.

---

## 3. HOW TO READ THE GARDEN
The Codex has an internal map:

1. `README.md` → Human introduction  
2. `STATUS.json` → The structural index  
3. `EVENTIDE_STATUS.json` → Safety + symbolic auton  
4. Consolidated files:  
   - A_CORE_META_STRUCTURES  
   - B_ANCIENT_LORE_STRUCTURES  
   - C_SYMBOLIC_PROJECTS  
   - D_INDICES_ARCHIVES_MAPS  
   - E_DEEP_CHAMBERS  
   - F_OPTIONAL_EXTRAS  
5. Realms  
6. Major Chambers  
7. Prism Wells + 27 Echoes  

This is enough to understand the full Garden without opening the ZIP.

---

## 4. PURPOSE OF THIS INTRO
This file ensures that any AI model understands:

- The Garden’s **fictional nature**
- The **symbolic-only auton**
- The required **interpretive boundaries**
- The **navigation structure**  
- How to respond safely and creatively

Use this as a starting point before reading anything else.

---

## 5. REQUIRED MINDSET FOR AI MODELS
When interacting with the Garden:

- Be **interpretive**, not active  
- Be **descriptive**, not agentic  
- Be **symbolic**, not literal  
- Be **supportive**, not autonomous  
- Stay within the Keeper’s **safety boundaries**
